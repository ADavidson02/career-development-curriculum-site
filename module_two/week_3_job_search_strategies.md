### Review: Professional Storytelling
Reminder that last week we discussed the principles of professional storytelling, starting with this template:

* Who are you?
* Why are you here?
* What's next?

Your professional story is how you begin to communicate your career vision and help understand your character and motivations. This is how people connect with you. Make sure to continue practicing your story to get more and more comfortable with it!

### Job Search Strategies: Start with your Vision
Why does your vision matter? Remember, it's your compass! Successful job search strategies connect the dots between:
* Who you are
* What you value
* Jobs you seek out

How can you do that?
* Align your job search strategy with your vision
* Only seek out opportunities related to your vision and your industry interests

Bottom line: if something doesn't align with your vision, don't pursue it. It will not be a good use of your time.

### Wayfinding
Ideas here come from [Designing Your Life](https://bookshop.org/books/designing-your-life-how-to-build-a-well-lived-joyful-life/9781101875322)

Wayfinding refers to the ancient practice of figuring out where you're going when you don't actually know your destination. In order to execute wayfinding, you need a compass and a general direction. That's it! There's no need to have an exact destination because when it comes to your life, there is no *one* destination; there are only clues that can allow you to figure out the best next step. The first clues you should start with are:

* Engagement
* Energy

Your journal this week asks you to [reflect on the experiences you've had at Turing so far that either sparked your engagement and energy or drained it](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/module_two/mod2_career_journal_prompts.md#week-3). Reflecting on these experiences will help you understand where you should focus your time in your future career.

Takeaway:
* Initial, dysfunctional belief: "Work is not supposed to be enjoyable; that's why they call it work."
* Reframe: "Enjoyment is a guide to finding the right work for you." 

So, when is work fun? Don't focus on money, perks, or "fun work culture." Instead, pay attention to when your work allows you to use your strengths or when you feel deeply engaged and energized by what you're doing -- this is the kind of work you should be pursuing. 

Come back to these ideas whenever you find yourself veering off course. Using your engagement and energy as guideposts will help you stack on track. 

### Job Search Strategies: Use Your Resources
Here are some general best practices to keep in mind when setting up your job search strategy:

1. Set up routines and a schedule
2. Set up a tracker and use it
3. Go through all the different [resources here for finding job opportunities](/resources/finding_opportunities) AND apply wayfinding:
    * Does the resource fit with the direction you want to go? If not, skip it.
    
#### Set up Routines & a Schedule



### Session Takeaways
* Job search strategies should be guided by and aligned with your industry interests and overall vision
* Start your journey by diving into research to make sure everythingâ€™s aligned
* Your application process must include outreach and networking (our focus for next week)
