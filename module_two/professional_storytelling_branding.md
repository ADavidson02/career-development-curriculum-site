### Objectives
* Understand the value and purpose of storytelling in both professional and personal relationship-building contexts


#### Connecting it all Together
We've been focusing on building awareness of:

* Our strengths
* Our values
* Our identities
* Our career vision

This week, we'll take that information to craft a **compelling story** that describes who you are, how you came to this industry, and where you see yourself going. This is a story that you'll tell employers, colleagues at networking events, and even your Turing community in order to find the right match for your future career.

From your professional story, we'll craft your resume, your Turing portfolio, update your LinkedIn, inspire others through blog posts, personal websites, projects, and more.  

## Professional Storytelling
We are all inherent storytellers. Stories are how we connect with each other. From fairy tales to novels to movies to podcasts, stories provide a way for people to share their experiences with others, building empathy and awareness of our universal experiences.

Storytelling is our first step in the job search at Turing. You are a member of the software industry now, and as you start connecting with others in the industry, you need to be able to tell the story of your transition -- how did you get here? How do you uniquely make up a part of this industry? 

Let's start by thinking about stories. What do you love about stories? Emma Coats, a former story artist for Pixar, shared her [22 rules for storytelling here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/pixar-tips-brave-artist-emma-coats-shares-her-storytelling-wit-and-wisdom-on-twitter%20followher/2012/06/25/gJQADaxd2V_blog.html), and we'll use some of them to apply them to our storytelling. We're going to start with rule #10:

    Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; 
    you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.

Consider: 
* What is a story that has inspired you in the past? 
* Why has that story stuck with you?

### Elements of a Story
Taking more lessons from Pixar as well as storytelling theory from Joseph Campbell, most stories (in the western tradition at least) follow the 3-Act Arc:

* Act I (Set-Up)
   * Call to adventure and accepts
   * Rules of the world are established
   * Inciting Incident

* Act II (Struggle)
   * Looking for ways to solve the problem
   * Learning what it will take to actually solve problem
   * Crisis/“Lowest of the low”

* Act III (Finale)
   * Show what’s been learned
   * Protagonist is changed

### How to Apply these Elements to Your Story
These elements are present in your story as well. You are the main character, the hero, undergoing challenges, experiencing a journey, and revealing the narrative thread through your own theme.

There are 3 main questions to help us understand our own stories and our character arcs:
* **Who are you?** *(as a developer, a teammate, a worker, a career changer)*
* **Why are you here?** *(Why software development? Why now? Consider both your background but also what drives you to be in this field)*
* **What's next?** *(Where do you see yourself going in this career?)* 

### How to Tell Your Story
Telling the story of your professional transition into software development helps others understand your motives, character, and capacity to reach the goals that you've set for yourself. In short, your story makes others believe in you.

Your story is one of **transition.** These stories are inherently interesting as they have all the elements of a classic story, and most importantly, they have the important elements of change, conflict, and tension around the transition. Where are you going? What will happen next? It's so exciting for the listener! But it also depends on how you tell that story. 

**Disclaimer:** When we say story, this is not something that has been made up or embellished in any way. People can tell when you're not being truthful. Rather, this is about how to make a true account of a career trajectory engaging and inspiring. 

During a networking event explored in this [Harvard Business Review article](https://hbr.org/2005/01/whats-your-story), senior managers who'd been downsized took turns telling what they had done before and what they were looking for next. Here are some takeaways:

* Stories that only recap a list of a person's resume are not interesting to the listener ("First I did this, then I did this, then I did this...")
* Stories that focus more on character motives, themes, and turning points -- the moments that cause your listener to ask, *"What happened next?"* -- are compelling to a listener.
