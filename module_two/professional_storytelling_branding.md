### Objectives
* Understand the value and purpose of storytelling in both professional and personal relationship-building contexts


#### Connecting it all Together
We've been focusing on building awareness of:

* Our strengths
* Our values
* Our identities
* Our career vision

This week, we'll take that information to craft a **compelling story** that describes who you are, how you came to this industry, and where you see yourself going. This is a story that you'll tell employers, colleagues at networking events, and even your Turing community in order to find the right match for your future career.

From your professional story, we'll craft your resume, your Turing portfolio, update your LinkedIn, inspire others through blog posts, personal websites, projects, and more.  

### Professional Storytelling
We are all inherent storytellers. Stories are how we connect with each other. From fairy tales to novels to movies to podcasts, stories provide a way for people to share their experiences with others, building empathy and awareness of our universal experiences.

Storytelling is our first step in the job search at Turing. You are a member of the software industry now, and as you start connecting with others in the industry, you need to be able to tell the story of your transition -- how did you get here? How do you uniquely make up a part of this industry? 

Let's start by thinking about stories. What do you love about stories? Emma Coats, a former story artist for Pixar, shared her [22 rules for storytelling here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/pixar-tips-brave-artist-emma-coats-shares-her-storytelling-wit-and-wisdom-on-twitter%20followher/2012/06/25/gJQADaxd2V_blog.html), and we'll use some of them to apply them to our storytelling. We're going to start with rule #10:

    Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; 
    youâ€™ve got to recognize it before you can use it.
