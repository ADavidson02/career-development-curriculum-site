### Review
[Week 3's session](/module_two/week_3_job_search_strategies) dove into resources and ideas for how to build your job search strategy. And this probably led to more questions about how to structure your time.

If that is the plan you follow, you will have a longer job search, guaranteed. Why? Because when you do this, you're not prioritizing what's important to you. You're not following your vision.
