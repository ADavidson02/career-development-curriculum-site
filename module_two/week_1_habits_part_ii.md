# Building Habits for Becoming a Software Developer, Part II
## Making New Habits Attractive and Easy

[Slides for this session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_SFwI3DLHHXCLZjqxugochHSei2BSwQDoI4p3Nl44kA/edit?usp=sharing)

### Learning Goals
* Build on your awareness of your current habits
* Utilize the laws of “make it attractive” and “make it easy” to improve your habits
* Implement temptation bundling to improve your motivation
* Apply new strategies within your environment design and everyday process to break down procrastination

### Review
Consider:

* What is something that is easier, more automatic for you to do now than when you started at Turing? 
* What specific behaviors and processes led to that becoming easier for you?  

These examples are habits, born out of feedback loops where we try different things to see what works in order to solve a problem. 


Let’s talk about outcome-based habits vs. identity-based habits
Cold Call/Ask for 1-2 volunteers: 
Who remembers what we mean when we say identity-based habits?
Call on 1-2 people to provide answers
Answer: our identities inform our habits
Going from “I want this” to “I am this”
The process of building habits is the process of adding/updating your identity to become the person you want to be
Review: Goals vs. Systems
Goals = focused on the results you want to achieve
Systems = the processes to get there
What should we prioritize? Systems
Why? 
1. Goals are restrictive
2. Goals are a momentary change
3. Systems are ongoing -- create lasting change
What employers really want to see from you
Bottom line: habits free up cognitive space so that you can learn something new

Journal Work Time (Slide 13)
Facilitator Talking Points:
Copy the new questions for this week into your career journal. Please label this new section of your career journal “Mod 2 Journal Reflections.”
You have 8 minutes to work on Prompts #1 and #2
Be ready to share takeaways from these reflections in your small group discussions next
Prompt #1:
Reflect on your habits from last module
Prompt #2:
Intentions for the module
Note to Facilitator:
While students are reflecting, create breakout rooms of 3-4 people

Small Group Discussion #1 (Slide 14)
Reminder of breakout norms
Discuss:
Share an effective habit you used last mod. What made it effective for you?
What do you want to improve on this module?
What habits do you want to try out in order to make those improvements?
Note to Facilitator:
While students are in breakout rooms, float into different rooms to make sure students are on task and to answer any clarifying questions about directions

New Material (Slides 15-21)
Facilitator Talking Points:
Review: last mod, we introduced the 4 laws of behavior change and spent time looking at the first one: make it obvious
For ineffective habits, the inverse is needed: make it invisible
This week, we’re going to look at the 2nd and 3rd laws:
Make it attractive
Make it easy
Making habits attractive:
The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming
How does something become attractive? It is the expectation of a reward at the end that motivates us to act at all
Which leads us to temptation bundling -- linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do
Students Read (5 mins)
This article on Temptation Bundling
Facilitator Talking Points:
Cold Call/Call on 1-2 volunteers:
What stood out to you from that article?
What do you want to try in your own habits based on what you read?
Now, the 3rd law: make it easy
We talk a lot about putting in reps when coding; why? (Cold call/ask for volunteer)
Because the most effective form of learning is practice, not planning. 
So, how can you apply that to your habits? To master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection; first takeaway of the 3rd Law: make it easy — by getting your reps in
We are motivated by what is most easy for us
Students Read (5 mins)
Article on Perfection vs. Repetition

Small Group Discussion #2 -- Same breakout rooms (Slide 22)
Reminder of breakout norms again
Discussion prompts:
In this same section of Atomic Habits, Clear writes: “One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where 1. your desired behavior is the ‘normal’ behavior and 2. you already have something in common with the group.” 
How can we build a culture within our cohorts where the desired behavior we all want to express is our collective norm? 
How will we encourage and hold each other accountable to holding effective habits throughout the entire module?
Note to Facilitator:
While students are in breakout rooms, float into different rooms to make sure students are on task and to answer any clarifying questions about directions

Synthesis (Slides 23-24) 
Facilitator talking points:
Cold call/ask for 1-2 volunteers:
What are your takeaways from our discussions and readings today? 
Journal work time for the rest of this week:
 Incorporate temptation bundling
Reframe hard habits
Follow-up: environment design for your habits
Apply the 2-min. rule to help you stop procrastinating
