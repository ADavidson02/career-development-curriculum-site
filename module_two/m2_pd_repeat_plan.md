title: PD Plan for Repeating Module 2
---

Repeating the module is an opportunity to not only solidify technical skills but also take advantage of extra time to work on your professional development and take concrete steps for your job search.

Reminder that in Mod 2, we covered the topics of:

* Self-awareness shown through ability to express one's strengths, values, and professional goals
* Create a vision for your career
* Create and follow through on effective job search strategies
* Best practices for building one's professional network

As you make your plan here, think about how you can push yourself to grow in these areas further.

Here's the breakdown of expectations for repeating the module:

### Sessions
This module, you are required to attend:

* Week 1: [Building Habits to Become a Software Developer, Part II](/module_two/week_1_habits_part_ii)
* Week 4: [Building Habits to Become a Software Developer, Part III](/module_two/week_4_habits_part_iii)

You are **not** required to attend any of the professional development sessions you have attended previously. If you choose to attend any sessions, please plan to fully participate in activities, including breakout group discussions. Reminder of the other weekly sessions:

* Week 2: [Professional Storytelling & Branding](/module_two/week_2_professional_storytelling_branding)
* Week 3: [Job Search Strategies](/module_two/week_3_job_search_strategies)
* Week 5: [Outreach & Networking I](/module_two/week_5_outreach_networking_i)

### Career Journal
1. Please create a new section of your career journal and title it "Mod 2 Repeat Journal Reflections."
2. For this module, you should consider 1-2 goals you want to work on and track your progress towards those goals. What should these goals look like? Whatever will be most helpful for your professional growth this module. Here are some examples:
  * Refining and practicing your professional story
  * Updating your LinkedIn profile
  * Implementing additional outreach with people from the Turing community or the tech community at large
  * Deciding on new strategies for your job search (i.e., refining the industries and companies you're looking at, conducting research on those companies, deciding next steps for outreach, etc.)

3. Please copy and paste these prompts into your career journal:

#### Week 1: [Building Habits to Become an Effective Software Developer, Part II](/module_two/week_1_habits_part_ii)
Ideas here are adapted from [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://bookshop.org/books/atomic-habits-an-easy-proven-way-to-build-good-habits-break-bad-ones/9780735211292)

1. Module 1's PD now includes a sesson on Part I of the habits series. Please read through that [session here](/module_one/week_3_building_habits). Reflect on your habits from last module. What behaviors and activities were helpful for you? What activities and behaviors could be more effective for you? What processes would you like to try differently this module to become more effective at your work and as a software developer? 

2. Setting intentions for this module: who do I want to be this module? What specific habits would help me get there? How are those habits tied to the identity of a software developer?

3. Incorporate [temptation bundling](https://jamesclear.com/temptation-bundling) to create a new habit by using this template:
  * After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED TO DO].
  * After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT TO DO].

4. How to enjoy “hard” habits: Reframe your habits to consider their benefits rather than their drawbacks; name 3 habits that you have to do and explain the benefits of them. How do they further your goals longterm? How will they add to your processes as a successful developer? At the end of the day, how do they add to your life?

5. Environment design (optional 5-min. additional reading: [Motivation is Overvalued. Environment Often Matters More](https://jamesclear.com/power-of-environment)): how does your environment set-up currently help you with your habits? How could it be improved to make it easier for you to follow through on your habits?

6. “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” Read this 4-min article on [how to stop procrastinating](https://jamesclear.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating). Apply the 2-minute rule to reframe 2-3 of your habits by scaling them down into the 2-minute version. How does this reframing help you think about shaping your new identity as a software developer?

#### Week 2: Goal Reflections
  * Name the 1-2 goals you'll work on this mod:
  * Reflections on week 1 (what went well? What would you like to do better? What do you need help with?):
  * Progress on your goal(s):
  * Progress on your habit(s):
  * New ideas or changes to put into place this week:

#### Week 3: Goal Reflections
  * Reflections on week 2 (what went well? What would you like to do better? What do you need help with?):
  * Progress on your goal(s):
  * Progress on your habit(s):
  * New ideas or changes to put into place this week:

#### Week 4: [Building Habits to Become an Effective Software Developer, Part III](/module_two/week_4_habits_part_iii)
Ideas here are adapted from [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://bookshop.org/books/atomic-habits-an-easy-proven-way-to-build-good-habits-break-bad-ones/9780735211292)
1. Assess your habits from week 3: how did you spend your time this past week? What was effective in your habits? What could be more effective? What steps will you take to make that happen?

2. Implement a reiforcement strategy: to make one of your habits more satisfying, what is a reward you can give yourself immediately after completing the habit? How will this reward encourage you to continue completing that habit?

3. "Don't Break the Chain": Use a habit tracker
* What is a habit that you want to make sure to do *every day*? How could you visually cue yourself to complete it (i.e., moving a paper clip)? How can you visually track it each time you've completed it? Could you automate the tracking? How will you do that?
* Need help? Check out one of these [habit tracking apps](https://www.lifehack.org/668261/best-habit-tracking-apps)

4. How to get back on track when missing a habit: if you miss a day or two of completing your habit, how will you get yourself going again?

5. Pick an accountability partner (your cohort accountabilibuddy, your mentor, a close friend, etc.) and create a habit contract with them. How often will you check in with each other? How will they hold you accountable?

#### Week 5: Goal Reflections
  * Reflections on week 4 (what went well? What would you like to do better? What do you need help with?):
  * Progress on your goal(s):
  * Progress on your habit(s):
  * New ideas or changes to put into place this week:
  * Reflections on the module as a whole (where have you improved? What do you want to continue doing in Module 3? What do you want to stop doing?):

**You are expected to be reflecting and responding to these weekly prompts every week during the module in your PD work time. If you have any questions about these expectations, please reach out to Allison.**
