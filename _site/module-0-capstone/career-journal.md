1. **Self Reflection** - Itâ€™s time to start thinking a little more about your interests and how they might fit into the workforce. What are you really good at? What are you passionate about? What do you find really challenging? Where do you want to live? What are your own personal goals? These questions are a framework, but feel free to go beyond these pieces. Your job search starts with yourself. 

2. **Company research** -  Start doing your research on companies that might be of interest to you. Pick a minimum of three companies in which you would like to target in your job search. What are the current technologies that they are using? What are the company values? Is there any interesting or relevant press related to this company? Is there anyone that you know that works at these companies? Take note of these questions and feel free to dive deeper as you do your research. The more you know about these companies the better your chances are of securing a job. 

3. **Outreach/Networking plan** - At this point, you should have a good understanding of what you want, and companies/industries that are of interest to you. Now take some time to develop a plan for outreach. Who are the key people I should connect with to secure a job? (Make a list of these people, we will be using it at a later time). Who do I have in my network that could be a mentor in my job search?  What events will I find people who work at the companies I am interested in? What knowledge or skills do I have that I can share with people in the industry? (Think of this in the context of a blog post or a lightning talk).
