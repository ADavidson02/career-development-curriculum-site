          <h3 id="discipline-hustle-and-skill">Discipline, Hustle, and Skill</h3>

<p>In this session we’ll work on HUSTLE – the work it takes to find a potential employer, convince them you’re worth the time to interview, and just maybe even hire.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>There’s only about a 1 in 4 chance that the job you eventually take will have been posted.</p>

<p>When you only read job listings, you’re <em>passively</em> waiting for more/better ones to be posted. Putting in more time means little additional possibility unless you broaden/lower your expectations.</p>

<p>If you can job hunt beyond listings, then you’re <em>actively</em> searching. The more time you put in, the deeper you dig, the more possibilities you find.</p>

<h2 id="how">How</h2>

<h3 id="developer-job-listings">Developer Job Listings</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Job listings are still worth something</li>
  <li>Junior jobs are heavily applied</li>
  <li>Applying for “senior” jobs that match your niche</li>
  <li>The “dummy”/”fishing” senior job posting</li>
  <li>You’re either hiring or you’re dying</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="practice">Practice</h4>

<p>Pick a city/region other than Denver/Boulder (it can just be for practice!) or SF and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find a local “hip” news source similar to Westword or Built In Colorado</li>
  <li>Find a set of awards that they’ve given in the last two years (“Company of the Year”, “Best Places to Work”)</li>
  <li>Did you know that companies typically pay or self-advocate/nominate to win these?</li>
  <li>Find at least five companies from these lists</li>
  <li>Are they hiring developers? Are there clues that they have developers? Do they sponsor things? Do they have a technical blog? Open source? What technologies to do they use?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="stepping-out-of-the-mainstream">Stepping Out of the Mainstream</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ruby? JavaScript? You’re more common than you used to be.</li>
  <li>The necessary lie of <code class="highlighter-rouge">jobs@company.com</code></li>
  <li>Developer jobs come in lots of shapes and sizes</li>
  <li>How is a job listing born?</li>
  <li>Diving deeper than developer job listings</li>
  <li>Consider the less-attractive technology/industry</li>
  <li>The devs there have more options than you do</li>
  <li>Any industry connection is a huge hook/differentiator</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="practice-1">Practice</h4>

<ul>
  <li>What kind of job experience do you have? Brainstorm three domains where that experience could possibly be relevant. If you were a bartender, you might come up with “Point of Sale Systems”, “Inventory/Fulfillment Processing”, and “Customer Happiness/Success”.</li>
  <li>Can you find two place for each of your domains where your experience could be an asset?</li>
  <li>Python, Java, and .NET are not hard to pick up. Can you find three companies who sound super interesting except that they use one of these languages?</li>
  <li>If you had three days to learn one of these languages, what resources would you use? Actually find the links and record them.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="community-building">Community Building</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Developers are getting old…and in charge</li>
  <li>Local &gt; Global</li>
  <li>Where is the community coming together?</li>
  <li>Meetups &amp; Conferences: who attends? who speaks? who sponsors?</li>
  <li>Look for a gathering that has between 10 and 50 attendees – these are community advocates</li>
  <li>Track them on Twitter, GitHub/Email, don’t bother with LinkedIn</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="practice-2">Practice</h4>

<ul>
  <li>What’s a topic that you’re interested in, not necessarily expert in, that attracts people? Data visualization? OpenGov? A certain language or framework? Entrepreneurs? A certain demographic in tech?</li>
  <li>Find a meetup in a place you’re interested in that is focused on that niche</li>
  <li>Find the events that have happened in the last three months</li>
  <li>Who spoke?</li>
  <li>Who sponsored?</li>
  <li>Who RSVPed?</li>
  <li>All of these are worth investigating and attempting to contact</li>
  <li>Use our GitHub techniques to find two people that you’ll <em>reach out to TODAY</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You’ve gotta sell when they’re in the buying mood</li>
  <li>Discipline keeps you ready to succeed</li>
  <li>Hustle gets you connected to potential</li>
  <li>Skill gets you a job</li>
</ul>
