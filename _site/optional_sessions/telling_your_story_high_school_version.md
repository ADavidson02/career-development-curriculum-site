#### The Why: Why Telling Your Story is Important
**Objectives:**
* Students will be able to understand how storytelling elements can be used to describe themselves
* Students will be able to create a story narrative to describe themselves
* Students will be able to share their story with others

Stories are how we connect with each other. From fairy tales to novels to movies to podcasts, stories provide a way for people to share their experiences with others, building empathy and awareness of our universal experiences.

Storytelling is an important part of your future career as well. As you build your resume or college applications or talk to potential employers, you need to be able to communicate who you are and what you hope to accomplish in your future. 

In this session, we'll focus on how you can craft a compelling story to describe who you are, your goals, and what your future holds. This is the start of you being able to tell your story professionally and find the right match for your future career.

### Opening
Let's start by thinking about stories. What do you love about stories? Emma Coats, a former story artist for Pixar, published [this post](http://storyshots.tumblr.com/post/25032057278/22-storybasics-ive-picked-up-in-my-time-at-pixar) with her 22 rules for storytelling. We're going to start with rule #10:

    Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; 
    youâ€™ve got to recognize it before you can use it.

**Turn & Talk:**

What stories stick with you and why? Think of a story that you love; maybe it's a story from childhood, maybe it's a movie you just watched or a book you just finished reading, or maybe it's a story that has been passed down through your family. Turn to the person next to you and take 2 minutes to retell that story, and then switch.

**Whole Group Debrief:**

Sharing from 1-2 people:

* What key details do you remember from your partner's story?
* How did your partner tell the story? 
* What made the story interesting?

This brings us to the elements that make up a good story -- what are they?

Possible answers: consistent theme, protagonist who faces and overcomes challenges, a journey of some kind, sequential plot that shows a beginning, middle, and end.

When it comes to character, what does it mean to be the hero of the story? What are the typical characteristics of a hero? 

**Connection to You:**
These elements are present in your story as well. You are the main character, the hero, undergoing challenges, experiencing a journey, and revealing the story through the goals you accomplish.

There are 3 main questions to help us understand our own stories and our character arcs:
* Who are you?
* What has brought you here?
* What do you hope for yourself in the next 5 years? 10 years?

### Activities: Make Yourself Into a Character (10-15 mins)
Where have you come from? What lenses do you view the world through? How has your family culture shaped you? We'll answer these questions through life maps.

Facilitator gives an example of a life map to demonstrate how to outline one's backstory. Note: this is an opportunity to share information about your backstory and how your highs and lows have shaped your pathway here.

Students:
1. Create their life maps using the paper and markers provided. 
2. On the back of the paper, draw a self-portrait of themselves right now. 
	* Suggestion: turn themselves into superheroes; what are their superpowers aka their strengths?

### Whole Group Share-Out
Solicit students who want to share anything about either their life maps or their character portraits. Guiding questions:

* How do you think your background drives you towards your future? 
* What are you proud of in your backstory?
* When you think about yourself as a character, what makes you someone that others want to root for?

### Activity: Write your story (5 mins)
Use your backstory and your character sketch to write a paragraph describing what your goals are in the future and how you'll reach them.

### Pair & Share (5 mins)
Students pair up and share their story drafts.

### Whole Group Debrief/Closing
Students can share their takeaways and recap importance of storytelling when it comes to communicating who you are in college essays, applications, etc.
