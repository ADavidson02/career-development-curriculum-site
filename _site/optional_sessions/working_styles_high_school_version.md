#### What Do Introversion and Extroversion Mean, Really? 
Who likes to spend time by themselves playing video games? Who enjoys talking through their ideas with their friends? Why do you like to do these things instead of a different activity? 

Often we think that introverts are shy and extroverts are outgoing. But in reality, it's about where you get your energy from, and this affects your ability to work effectively. Furthermore, everyone exists on the spectrum of introversion and extroversion, and our place on that spectrum can change depending on our current circumstances.

### Working Styles & Preferences 
On the imaginary line presented by your Facilitator, think about where you fall in the spectrum of introversion and extroversion when you're working with others. Many times you can say that your intro/extro/ambiversion might depend on the situation. In this case, we want you to select the place on the spectrum that you are most often in when working with other students.

### Small Group Discussion #1 
With 2-3 people who are standing near you on the line, form a group and grab a piece of chart paper to answer the following questions:

* What are you like? What kinds of activities do you like to do based on your place on the spectrum?
* What strengths do you bring to group projects? 
* What challenges have you faced because of your working style?
* What do you think others think of you?

### Small Group Discussion #2
Now, find an opposing group to discuss:

* What are the differences between us? 
* How can we learn to work together successfully?

## Whole Group Share 

* Ask for introvert groups and extrovert groups to describe their main attributes and strengths
* What are some ways that opposing styles could work together?
* Why do you think I had you do this exercise today?

## Takeaways:
* Self-awareness is important for learning how to work with others as well as knowing how to talk about yourselves in professional situations
