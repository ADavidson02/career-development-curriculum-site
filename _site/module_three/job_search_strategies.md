[Slides for this session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cMJwVIn7QY4txtLLUfGrb-gF1A9PuWxyVfJuSqeKE4U/edit?usp=sharing)

### Facilitator Instructions
There are facilitator notes throughout this markdown to divide up responsibilities in the session, assuming there are 2 instructors (1 BE and 1 FE) in the session. Please read through this markdown ahead of the session, decide who is going to be Facilitator #1 and who will be Facilitator #2, and let Allison know if you have any questions.

### Overview of Session
Session length: 60 minutes

**Facilitator #1:** Using slide #3-8, go through the following:

**Slide #3:** 

* Opening (10 mins)
* Job Searching Tracking Intro (10 mins)
* New Strategies & Tools (10 mins)
* Individual Work Time (10 mins)
* Group Discussion (10 mins)
* Share Out & Closing (5 mins)

### Opening

**Slide #4:**

#### Objectives

* Understand all components that go into an effective job search 
* Devise a step-by-step strategy for a job application, including research, outreach, and follow-up
* Create and effectively use a job search tracker for your job search with Huntr
* Start a list of companies and jobs to research

**Slide #5:**

Focusing your job search strategy solely on job postings is not the best idea. 

Applying for jobs on sites like monster.com, Indeed, and other career listing sites can be discouraging and ineffective. As little as [20-30% of job listings](http://www.npr.org/2011/02/08/133474431/a-successful-job-search-its-all-about-networking) are being posted online. That means that when you're _only_ looking at company job postings, you are decreasing your chances of finding a job significantly. 

In contrast, [referral candidates](http://www.careerxroads.com/news/SourcesOfHire2013.pdf) are 3-4 times more likely to be hired than non-referral candidates. To add yourself to those numbers, today we'll talk about how to find a job without relying on just a job posting. 

**Slide #6:**

#### Group Discussion
Form groups of 3-4 people, decide on a notetaker, and in your journal, create a list to answer these questions:

* Beyond looking at job postings, what are the steps you should take for a successful job search as a junior developer? 
* What resources should you use along the way?

After 5 minutes of brainstorming, each group should pair up with another and share your lists with each other. Then 2-3 students share out:
* What trends do you see?
* What is something new you hadn’t thought of?
* What will be challenging for you to do in the job search?

**Note to Facilitators:** One facilitator can call on students and another can write on the board the items that they list.

Now that you have an idea of what you'll need to do, how can you keep track of these things? Use a job tracking system!

**Facilitator #2:** Using slides #10-13, go through the following:

### Prep for Your Job Search: Using a Tracker

**Slides #10 & 11:**

The first step to a successful job search is to utilize a tracking system. Having a system to keep track of everything from companies you're interested in to notes from coffee meetings will be highly beneficial in staying organized in the job search. We'll get set up today using [Huntr](https://huntr.co/) as your tracker. Here's what you should know:

* Huntr works similarly to Trello. You can create cards for specific companies and then move them to the different lists as you complete specific steps (applied, interview, offer, etc.)
* Start by reading through this guide to [using Huntr here](https://help.huntr.co/for-job-seekers/huntr-quickstart-guide)
* Install the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/huntr-job-search-tracker/mihdfbecejheednfigjpdacgeilhlmnf) to add a job posting right from its source
* Start customizing your board!

**You Do:** Spend 5 minutes logging in, setting up your board, and reading through the info here to familiarize yourself with Huntr

### The Process

**Slide #13:**

So if you aren't going to just apply to a posting on a job board, what is your process?

Here are helpful tips for the process:
1. Find a job opportunity that interests you
  * Use one of the job searching tools below
2. Conduct research
  * Go to the company's site and find out about their mission, product, customer base, blog posts
  * Conduct a Google search on articles or other information about the company
  * If the company has any open source projects on GitHub, check them out
  * Find people who work at the company using LinkedIn
3. Do some cold outreach
  * Who do you reach out to?
    * Developers: Both juniors and seniors will be helpful to talk to and find out information about the company, what it's like to work there, and what to expect in the interview process
    * Use LinkedIn to see if you have any mutual connections who can make an introduction
  * Set up a coffee meeting or phone call
    * Ask questions! Gather information to use in your cover letter and resume
4. Complete the Application
  * Customize your resume for the position
  * Write a tailored cover letter
  * Mention the contact you met
5. Go back to your Contact
  * Let them know you've applied

Reminder: Update Huntr in every step of the process. 

**Facilitator #1:** Using slides #14-20, go through the following:

### Where to Begin: Finding Opportunities

**Slide #14:**
How can you use these sites listed here to find opportunities? 

**Note to Facilitator #1:** Instruct students to open this markdown to start looking through all of the many resources available to them. 

**Slide #15:**
**Facilitator shares:** You can narrow down companies who are doing the kind of work you want to do. Compare them and track them on Owler. Follow them on LinkedIn.

  * Online shopping platforms
  * Public services
  * Streaming services

How do you search for these? Start with Google!

**Slide #22:**

#### Search by...outreach & social media
**Facilitator shares:** In addition to finding the right posting, remember that the next step is to find a face at the company to connect with. LinkedIn will be your go-to site for this, but a great way to continue the research into places you want to work that are aligned with your goals is by building your network. Below are some suggestions for groups to utilize for this purpose:

* [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/)
   * Tips: Search for groups local to the area you’re interested in working and in topics that you're interested in pursuing (i.e. Ruby, JavaScript, etc.). Be sure to select "Groups" (not "Calendar"). On the group page, there are two things that will be very useful to your job search:
      * Organizers list: who are they? Where do they work? What other meetups are they active in?
      * Upcoming events: look at the RSVP list; Who else is going? What companies do they work for?
