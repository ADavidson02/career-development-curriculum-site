# Module Four Professional Development Peer Group Guidelines

## Overview
Welcome to Module Four! This is when you’ll kick your job search into high gear, and to assist with that, you will meet with your peer group each Thursday to discuss strategies and find ways to hold each other accountable. A Turing staff member will also be available as a coach to help your group stay on track and offer advice when needed.

## Accountability -- what does this look like for your group? 
To make this a safe and easy place to share with each other, make sure to set some norms for how the group will operate. Remember to utilize principles of Nonviolent Communication, active listening, feedback, how different strengths in your group are working together, where you all are on the introversion/extroversion scale, and how you appreciate communication and motivation. **In other words, DTR with each other on how you will hold each other accountable to ensure that everyone is an equal part in this discussion.**

Here are some suggestions on how to create accountability systems:
* Start each meeting with a Stand Up to give updates on your job search action steps
* Create a Slack channel to post updates in throughout the week when you’re not meeting with each other
* Identify what motivates you and share with your group how they can support that motivation
* Share your barriers with your group as you come across them so that they can help you move past them

## How to utilize your coaches:
You'll meet with your coach each Thursday from 1-2pm. Your coach can also be available for questions outside of that time on Slack or during another agreed-upon time. 
* DTR with your coach to set clear expectations on what your group and the coach will work on together and how you appreciate feedback
* Keep them updated. Let them know your needs at any given time -- what questions do you have? Where is your group getting stuck? What advice do you need?
* Create an agenda for your meetings with them so that you can maximize time. Send this agenda to them ahead of time.
* Share your action steps and accountability metrics with them so that they can help support these with follow-up
* Ask for help:
    * Reviewing resumes, Turing portfolios, cover letters, LinkedIn, etc.
    * Finding interview prep resources
    * Practice storytelling
