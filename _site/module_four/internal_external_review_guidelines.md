# Weeks 2 & 3 Professional Development: Guidelines for Module 4 Student Reviews
## Providing Feedback on Resumes, Cover Letters, LinkedIn, Turing Portfolios, GitHub profiles, and Professional Stories

### Internal Review
Time Structure for Session: 60 mins
* 5-7 mins: Quick 1 minute status update from each group member and helpful tips they brought for each other
* 35-50 mins: Review each student's tailored resume and cover letter (see below on expectations)
* 5-20 mins *(remaining time depends on how many group members there are)*: Coaches give an overview of the External Review (see below) and provide work time with any remaining time

Students should come prepared with a tailored resume and cover letter for a specific position for which they are interested. They should either bring hard copies of each for all group members or they should share links to both the resume and cover letter in their group Slack channels. Each student will then have 5-10 minutes in the session to discuss their tailored resume and cover letter. 

#### Expectations:
* When presenting, students should give a brief overview of the role and the company
* Everyone in the group should read over the resume and cover letter
* Using the guiding questions below, everyone in the group provides feedback and asks clarifying questions
* Student presenter will answer questions where needed, but their main role is to listen and take notes on feedback

**Guiding Questions for Feedback:**
* How does the resume communicate the skills and story of the student? 
    * What makes this an effective resume? 
    * Do you have a clear sense of what kind of work the student has produced? 
    * Does the resume give a sense of the student's career trajectory? How would you describe the student based on the resume?
    * Is Turing listed on the resume?
    * Is the resume aligned with the position (i.e., If the position is for a Rails developer, does the student showcase Rails projects? Is Rails listed in the skills section?)
    * Are technical skills and projects near the top of the resume? Is the layout clean and interesting to look at?
    
* How does the cover letter communicate the student's interest in the job and ability to do it? 
    * Hook: Does the first paragraph draw you in as the reader (i.e., what is memorable about the cover letter? What stands out about the student?)? 
    * Does the cover letter expand on the resume in a logical way? How do they highlight their relevant skills?
    * Does the cover letter describe value that the student can bring to the role/company?
 
Both the coach and fellow group members should provide feedback. **For coaches who have more than 1 group:** Make sure that the groups are clear on expectations so that they can review each other's resumes and cover letters on their own when you're with your other group

After everyone has had a turn for review, please use the remaining time in the session to go over the External Review for which students should have prepared:

* Elevator pitch version of their professional story
* Tailored resume
* Tailored cover letter
* LinkedIn profile
* Turing alumni portfolio
* GitHub profile 

Professionals from partnering companies will pick 1 of these at random to review with the student, so they should have **all** of these ready to present. 

### External Review
During Thursday of Week 3, Module 4 students will undergo an external review with mentors or professionals from partnering companies in which they will present 1 of the following:
* Elevator pitch version of their professional story
* Tailored resume
* Tailored cover letter
* LinkedIn profile
* Turing alumni portfolio
* GitHub profile 

#### Expectations for the Reviewer:
Choose 1 of the professional pieces above to ask each student to present -- students should come prepared to present any of them. Please have students each present a different piece for the group in order for them to hear feedback on a variety of professional pieces; you may have more than one student show a specific piece based on group size

Youâ€™ll be with a group of 5-7 students and can break down the 60-minute timeframe in this way:
* 5 minutes for introductions: give a brief overview of your background and career trajectory and students will introduce themselves
* 7-10 minutes for each student: students will present their professional piece and receive your feedback
* Any time remaining could be used for a Q&A

Provide students with specific, actionable, and kind feedback that reflects your experience in the industry -- we want students to get an honest perspective. 

Here are some guiding questions for you to use when structuring your feedback:
* What stands out to you about this piece? What does it communicate about the student? Does the student present themselves in a unique way? If so, how?
* How clear is the information presented? What questions do you still have?
* What recommendations do you have for improvement?
* Would you consider hiring (or at least continuing the hiring process with) this student based on the information presented?

#### Expectations for students: 
* Come to the meeting prepared for present any of the potential professional pieces
* Stick to their allotted time frame to allow equal feedback time for the whole group
* Ask relevant questions
* Take notes
