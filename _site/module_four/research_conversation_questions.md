# Research Conversation Questions
This list is meant to give you an idea of questions you can ask when you go to a coffee meeting with someone from the software industry. It is in no way exhaustive, and you should always think about the questions that matter the most to *you,* but use this list to begin your brainstorm. 

* What are you working on right now?
* What does a typical day look like for you? 
* How did you get started in software? 
* What part of this job do you personally find most satisfying? Most challenging? 
* What are some of the trends in the industry? What changes are happening in this industry? 
* What’s the biggest piece of advice you’d give to junior developers?
* How do junior developers fit into your team structure?
* What have you learned on the job to be effective in your role?
* How would you describe the culture and values of your company?
* What is a mistake you made early in your career that I can avoid?
* What are you most proud about in your career so far?
