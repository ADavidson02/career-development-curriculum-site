## Part One
Note for Facilitator: Split the students up into groups based on their comfort level with creating schedules

It's time to build out your 30-day post-grad plan, starting with your schedule. Keep in mind that Mod 5 sessions will be offered on Mondays for weeks 2, 3, and 4. 

### Already Organized Group
These students should:
1. Map out the intermission week schedule on the board in Clarke Hall and have them add events/meetups and sessions that they can lead and review with each other during that time
2. Discuss the schedule they're setting up:
  * Coding
  * Company research & tracking
  * Outreach & Networking
  * Interview Prep
  * Housekeeping (refining your professional story, updating your resume, writing cover letters, updating your Turing portfolio, updating your LinkedIn profile)
  * Other (social networking, blogging, planning talks, etc.)
  * Check-ins with Turing staff
* Lean into their strengths:
  * If you're a routine person, stick to the same routine each day
* Be aware of pitfalls:
  * Don't overschedule yourself
3. Create an accountability system for the cohort:
  * How will they help each other stay accountable to these schedules? 
  * Who from the other group will they check in with?

### Not Organized Group
These students should:
1. Find a calendar system that they'll use, such as Google Calendar
2. Set up the calendar by creating timeboxes for how to spend their time during the first 4 weeks post-Turing
3. Set up notifications
4. Add meetups, Mod 5 sessions (when applicable), Jeff's office hours, self-care time
5. Get very specific with how they're spending each chunk of time
  Ex: Update ReadMe for Personal Project from 10am-11am on the first Tuesday
6. Create accountability system:
  * Who will they check in with on staying accountable to their plans?

## Part Two
All students make goals for what they need to work on during those 30 days, such as:
* Updating ReadMes
* Refactoring projects
* Adding projects to their alumni portfolios
* Improve cover letters

### Refresh on Jobtrack
Reminder for students on how to use Jobtrack.io using Kayt's dummy account (log-in info pinned in the Career Dev channel). 

### Survey
Students take survey for Mod 5 sessions. 

### Share Out
3-4 students share out highlights from their plans with the whole group
