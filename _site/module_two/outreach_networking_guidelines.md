# Outreach & Networking Plan
As we've discussed, meeting people, forming relationships, and having conversations are the key pieces to getting your foot in the door at any company. It's important to be proactive in your approach to outreach and networking, so it's necessary to make a plan for what you'll try to further your networking. 

Identify a contact you will reach out to by the end of this module. This could be a mentor, alum, or anyone from your current network. Describe:

1. Who your contact is, why you want to connect with them, and what you want to talk about
2. When you will contact them by and how you plan to meet
3. What your follow-up will look like once you've met with them
4. What other steps will you take to start building a stronger network in the tech community?
