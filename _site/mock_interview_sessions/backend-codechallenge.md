## BACK-END TECHNICAL CHALLENGE

**Interviewer:** You have three really big arrays. All of them are sorted lists of unique numbers, but there may be common numbers found in all three arrays. How would you find the first common element in all three arrays?

**Candidate:** Before I start coding, I'd like to write out some quick notes and then reiterate the problem, if that's okay with you?

**Interviewer:** Yes, of course.

**Candidate:** (Connected to the TVs, do some psuedo coding and thinking aloud, then start solving)

### pause - things to note

* If there's a whiteboard, or you have your notebook, and it would help you to draw or write something out, do it!
* Psuedo-code your thought process, talk things through first.
* **Don't immediately jump into trying to code just for the sake of time or because you're nervous.**
* While you're coding, you can communication in many different ways. One excellent approach is explaining what you're doing as if you were tutoring a new student at Turing -- you'll show more confidence in your code if you explain WHY you're taking a particular approach.
* You're not going to get the best solution the first time around or during the interview - that's ok. If you come up with something better after you get home, feel free to send it to them in an email.
