# Career Development, Mock Interview Sessions

The Career Development team has some practice scenarios that will be practiced / role-played in front of
students.

While the instructors work through the role-play session, students are encouraged to post questions
in the **#job-hunt** channel in Slack where a moderator will collect the more popular/burning questions
to ask in a collective Q&A session at the end.
