## Goals

* Demonstrate how to use prior experience and specific examples of your work to give in-depth answers
* Emphasize the importance of using the correct vocabulary, and being able to explain the terms you use
* Demonstrate how to definitively answer questions, even when you don't know the answers
* Demonstrate how to ask clarifying questions when you need more information


### Question 1

**Interviewer:** Can you explain to me how CSS grid works?

**Interviewee:** So I've never actually worked with it before, but I know it can be used for creating fluid layouts that make it easier to do responsive design. In my projects I've achieved the same effect by using flexbox and setting element widths as percentages rather than hard-coded pixel values. I think maybe we didn't learn CSS grid because it might not be supported in a lot of browsers just yet, which makes cross-browser compatibility really difficult.

**Interviewer:** What do you mean by cross-browser compatibility?

**Interviewee:** Blah blah blah, talk about cross-browser compatibility

#### Discuss

* Mentioned I haven't worked with that particular technology, but did my best to explain what I **do** know based on prior experience
* Used the term 'cross-browser compatibility' - if I'm going to throw that out there, I better be able to explain it
* Interviewer asked me about cross-browser compatibility next, in a way that made it sound like I said something wrong. Don't get thrown off by that, just answer their question the best you can.
* Really definitively ended my answer so they knew I was done talking. Didn't express anything like a question.


### Question 2

**Interviewer:** So part of our tech stack here is phoneGap, which you'll have to work with a bit. Can you tell me what benefits working with that kind of technology gives us?

**Interviewee:** I've actually never heard of that before, but I can look into it and get back to you. I'd assume by the name it facilitates some sort of mobile development which we learned a little bit about at Turing.

**Interviewer:** What did you learn about it?

**Interviewee:** Blah blah, talk about react native and PWAs


#### Discuss

* It's ok to not know the answer. But **do** know how to gracefully say that.
* Don't spend forever trying to bullshit something - if you can make a quick, eloquent educated guess, go for it. Otherwise tell them you'll get back to them. That expresses interest and curiosity in learning more.
* Find ways to talk about what you **do** know and show that you're excited/passionate about them


### Question 3

**Interviewer:** Have you ever used an HTML templating engine?

**Interviewee:** Hmm, it sounds familiar but I'm not sure off the top of my head. Could you give me a couple of examples?

**Interviewer:** Sure, have you ever heard of handlebars or mustache or ejs?

**Interviewee:** Oooh yeah, I have seen those in some open source codebases that I dug into a couple weeks ago. It looks like they're used for incorporating dynamic values into HTML. Is there a particular one that the engineering team here uses?

**Interviewer:** Yea, we're currently working with Handlebars.

**Interviewee:** (writes that down in notebook)

#### Discuss

* Ask clarifying questions
