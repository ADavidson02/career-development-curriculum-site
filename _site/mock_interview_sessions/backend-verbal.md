## ANSWERING IN-DEPTH, USING PRIOR EXPERIENCE

**Interviewer:** Can you explain to me how MVC works?

**Interviewee:** MVC stands for Model View Controller, and we use it to separate the logic of the code from how we want to present that code. This makes our code more modular and reusable, and makes it easier to, say, refactor how our backend works without changing the visual appeal of the application. Likewise, if we want to change how the site works, we have an easy separation of that work from how our application processes data. The Model is where we typically manage the storage and retrieval of our data, like in a database or external files. The View is our presentation logic and how we form our response. In our projects at Turing, the Controller is typically called from Rails and manages the Model to store/retrieve data, and Rails hands off the data payload to the View in order to build the response.

**Interviewer:** Which code, then, is **supposed** to be responsible for manipulating data: the controller or the model?

**Candidate:** Blah blah blah, talk about how our instruction at Turing taught us to put data manipulation in the model, but that there could be other ways of accomplishing the same thing. I'd love to dig into other strategies and look at the benefits.

### pause - things to note

* Mentioned up front my understanding was limited to what I've learned and done at Turing
* Interviewer asked me a follow-up question that I didn't have a clear answer for and that I'm excited to keep learning
* Really definitively ended my answer so he knew I was done talking.



## DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER

**Interviewer:** I see you have a Rails background, but our tech stack is C# and .NET. Why do you think we use those
technologies here?

**Candidate:** I'm aware that C# is a different programming language and I believe .NET is a framework, but I have no experience using them. I'd love to draw comparisons between Ruby and C#, and again for Rails and .NET to see how I could transfer my knowledge in those other areas to your tech stack and get back to you. For example, if .NET was also an MVC framework, I think I could get up to speed on that framework more easily based on what I've done in Rails.

### pause - things to note

* It's ok to not know the answer. But **do** know how to gracefully say that.
* Don't spend forever trying to guess at something - if you can make a quick, eloquent educated guess, go for it. Otherwise tell them you'll get back to them. That expresses interest and curiosity in learning more.
* Find ways to talk about what you **do** know and show that you're excited/passionate about continuing to learn



## VAGUE QUESTIONS, NOT SURE WHAT THEY'RE ASKING

**Interviewer:** Explain to me how indexing works in a relational database.

**Candidate:** Can you please clarify for me: do you mean creating an index in a table, or something else?

**Interviewer:** Yes, like why you would add indexes on a table and so on..

**Candidate:** Blah blah blah answer the question

### pause - things to note

* Ask clarifying questions!!
* Start vague, they will dig deeper based on your response and ask you additional questions to get you to answer the way they want



## Other notes

* ALWAYS have questions for the interviewer (there are TONS of resources online about appropriate questions to ask)
* Always send a thank you email a few hours after your meeting (it could be the difference between choosing you or someone else for the job) and be sure to include any information or topics you said you would look into or get back to them.
