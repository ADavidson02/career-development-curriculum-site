      <td>Opening (5 mins)</td>
      <td>Using slides 3 and 4, introduce the objectives and deliverable for the session. Make sure to post the <a href="/module_one/strengths_storytelling_reflection.md">template for the deliverable</a> in the cohorts’ Slack channels. For any students repeating the module, they’ll complete this <a href="/module_one/strengths_storytelling_follow-up.md">deliverable</a> instead. Using slide 6, say: <strong>“Stories are how we connect with ourselves and each other. From fairy tales to novels to movies to podcasts, stories provide a way for people to share their experiences with others, building empathy and awareness of our universal experiences. Storytelling is our first step in the job search at Turing. You are a member of the software industry now, and as you start connecting with others in the industry, you need to be able to tell the story of your transition – how did you get here? How do you uniquely make up a part of this industry? In this session and throughout your career development at Turing, we’ll focus on how you can craft a compelling story to describe who you are, how you came to this industry, and where you see yourself going. This is a story that you’ll tell employers, colleagues at networking events, and even your Turing community. Today we are going to start that preparation by sharing more about what brought you here and what you hope to accomplish. This is the start of you being able to tell your story professionally and find the right match for your future career. Let’s start by thinking about stories…“</strong></td>
      <td>Students listen, take notes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Turn &amp; Talk (5 mins)</td>
      <td>Using slide 7, say: <strong>“What do you love about stories? Emma Coats, a former story artist for Pixar, published a blog post with her 22 rules for storytelling. We’re going to start with rule #10: ‘Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.’“</strong> Instruct the students to turn and talk to the person next to them and share a story that they love or has stuck with them – maybe from their childhood or something they’ve read or seen recently. After 5 minutes, call on 2 different people to give some highlights of their partners’ stories and why they’ve stuck with them. Say: <strong>“What key details do you remember from your partner’s story? What made the story interesting?”</strong></td>
      <td>Students participate in turn and talk discussions; they respond with answers when prompted</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Intro to storytelling elements (5 mins)</td>
      <td>Facilitator moves to Slide 8 and says: <strong>“This brings us to the elements that make up a good story – what are they?”</strong> Call on students/cold call. Possible answers: <em>consistent theme, protagonist who faces and overcomes challenges, a journey of some kind, sequential plot that shows a beginning middle and end.</em> Say: <strong>“These elements are present in your story as well. You are the main character, undergoing challenges, experiencing a journey, and revealing the narrative thread through your own theme. There are 3 main questions to help us understand our own stories and our character arcs: 1. Who are you? 2. Why are you here? 3. What’s next? We’ll start building our stories by connecting with ourselves through these 3 questions to describe: our backstories, our current struggles and successes, and our futures.”</strong></td>
      <td>Students listen, take notes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Backstories Discussion &amp; Activity (15 mins)</td>
      <td>Facilitator switches to slide 9 and discusses life maps. Say: <strong>“To answer the question ‘who are you,’ we need to consider where we’ve come from, the lenses we see the world through, the highs and lows we’ve had in our experience, and how all these things shape our sense of identity. We’ll do that using life maps.”</strong> Facilitator should showcase their own life map or you can use Allison’s <a href="/files/Allison's%20Life%20Map.pdf">here</a>. Then instruct students to get a piece of cardstock and a marker to create their own life maps. They will have approximately 10 minutes to do so. Walk around to make sure everyone’s on task and to see if they have any questions.</td>
      <td>Students create life maps</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Current Struggles &amp; Successes Discussion (10 mins)</td>
      <td>Using slide 10, say: <strong>“Now let’s think about that next question, ‘why are you here?’ We’ll do that today by thinking about our current struggles and successes at Turing..”</strong> Switch to slide 11 and say: <strong>“Another rule from Emma Coats is that <em>you admire a character for trying more than for their successes,</em> meaning that we root for a character to overcome struggles and adversity. As the character in our own stories, we need to be able to access our vulnerabilities to authentically tell this part of our story – and our listeners will thank us for it because this is how they relate to us. Let’s look at an example of this.”</strong> Switch to slide 12 and read through the message from Jeff. Ask the students: <strong>“What is the challenge here? How did he overcome it? How does this help you understand Jeff?”</strong> Cold call or call on raised hands for each of the questions. Possible answers: <em>challenge was learning functional programming; he used a strategy to learn new things; now we know that Jeff struggles to learn new things sometimes too.</em> Then, switch to slide 13 and introduce the idea of sharing our identities to provide context for our motivations, values, and passions. Switch to slide 14 and read through Victoria’s story. Ask the students: <strong>“How would you describe Victoria as a character in this story? How do you know? What character arc is developing here? How does this help you understand Victoria more?”</strong>Cold call or call on raised hands for each of the questions. Possible answers: <em>She was introverted but also rebellious; know this because she tried out new lifestyles in her adulthood; she wants to keep learning new things and continue to build on her identities as a farmer and connection to political memory through software, etc.</em> Switch to slide 15 and discuss the idea of owning your strengths. <em>Facilitator provides an example of how you’ve seen one of your StrengthsFinder strengths in action to help you in your work.</em></td>

    <tr>
      <td>Current Struggles &amp; Successes Activity (10 mins)</td>
      <td>Using slide 16, instruct students to answer the first 2 questions from their deliverable in a gist; the questions are on the slide. They should silently work on their own. Circulate the room to make sure students are on task</td>
      <td>Students write quietly.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Futures Discussion &amp; Activity (10 mins)</td>
      <td>Using slide 17, say: <strong>“Now, let’s think about our futures to answer the question ‘what’s next?’ Think back to why you applied to Turing; what dreams do you envision for yourself? Where does your Turing story end?”</strong> Solicit answers from 2-3 students for those questions. Say: <strong>“Let’s make these dreams a reality by creating a vision statement. This statement should utilize the first person (‘I will…’) and include concrete details to fully express where you want to go.”</strong> Instruct the students to spend 6 minutes writing or drawing out a vision statement.</td>
      <td>Students participate in discussion, write out their vision statements.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Small Group Discussion (20 mins)</td>
      <td>Facilitator switches to slide 18 and instructs students to get into groups of 3-4 people to share any of the pieces of their story that they’ve constructed during the session. Say: <strong>“Share as much as you’re comfortable with, but you’ll get 3-5 minutes to practice these storytelling skills with your group members.”</strong> Instruct students that after they have all shared, they should discuss the question in red on the slide: <strong>“By sharing our stories with one another, how can we as a community build on our similarities and learn from our differences?”</strong> Circulate the room to ensure all groups are on task and sharing airtime.</td>
      <td>Students get into groups and participate in discussions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Whole Group Takeaways &amp; Closing (5 mins)</td>
      <td>Facilitator switches to slide 19 and calls on 2-3 groups to answer the questions off the slide. Then move through slides 20 and 21 to remind students to finish their deliverable and to let them know what other PD activities will be coming up to build on this initial practice.</td>
      <td>Students share answers in discussion</td>
