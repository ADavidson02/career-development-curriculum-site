<h3 id="overview-of-professional-development-at-turing">Overview of Professional Development at Turing</h3>
<p>Turing’s <strong>mission</strong> is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.</p>

<p>Turing’s career development curriculum is created directly out of this mission with a focus on <strong>unlocking students’ potential</strong> in modules one and two through cultivating self-awareness and empathy. In modules three and four, curriculum focuses on providing strategies to empower students to <strong>succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers</strong> by creating connections within the technology industry, building competencies for industry leadership, and securing a fulfilling career – and not just another job.</p>

<p>The touchstones of this curriculum include these mindsets:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Agency:</strong> Taking initiative and ownership over your learning and work</li>
  <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> Understanding and sharing others’ emotions in order to relate to them</li>
  <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Active participation in community</li>
  <li><strong>Grit:</strong> A combination of perseverance and passion</li>
  <li><strong>Growth:</strong> A belief that your abilities can be developed through dedication, hard work, and resiliency</li>
</ul>

<p>From this, we aim for students to develop a self-awareness that allows them to speak to their strengths and build connections with developers and others in this industry. StrengthsFinder is a tool that will help you get started!</p>

<p>Today’s session focuses on building awareness of your own strengths as well as the strengths of those in your cohort.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Understand what a strength is and how to develop it</li>
  <li>Reflect on StrengthsFinder results</li>
  <li>Familiarize yourself with each other’s strengths</li>
  <li>Practice talking about yourself</li>
  <li>Create goals for your professional development at Turing using StrengthsFinder</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="optional-deliverable">Optional Deliverable</h3>
<p>Reflection is a powerful tool in helping us improve. Complete this <a href="/module_one/strengths_reflection_guidelines.md">reflection</a> in your own gist and DM it to Allison if you would like to schedule a coaching session to discuss it.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>### The Why<br />
How would you answer these questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do you talk about yourself?</li>
  <li>How do you want others to describe you?</li>
  <li>What do you want to be known for?</li>
  <li>How in tune are you with yourself?</li>
</ul>

<p>StrengthsFinder can help you answer these!</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-strength">What is a Strength?</h3>
<p>The StrengthsFinder assessment doesn’t measure strengths exactly – instead, it’s examining the presence of certain talents in <a href="/files/BriefDescriptionsOfThemes.pdf">34 areas</a>. Strengths are rather the product of building one’s talents combined with skills and knowledge. Here is the breakdown of this development:</p>

<p>A <strong>strength</strong> is the ability to consistently produce a positive outcome through near-perfect performance in a specific task.</p>

<p>A strength is composed of:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Your basic abilities to perform the fundamental steps of a task, such as your basic ability to move through the fundamental steps of operating a computer. Skills do not naturally exist within us; they must be acquired through formal or informal training and practice.</li>
  <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Simply what you know, such as your awareness of historical dates and your grasp of the rules of a game. Knowledge does not naturally exist within us; it must be acquired through formal or informal education.</li>
  <li><strong>Talents:</strong> The ways in which you naturally think, feel, and behave, such as the inner drive to compete, sensitivity to the needs of others, and the tendency to be outgoing at social gatherings. Although talents must come into existence naturally and cannot be acquired like skills and knowledge, we each have unique talents within us.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because your most powerful talents represent the best of your natural self, they are your best opportunities to perform at levels of excellence and from which to build strengths.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your <strong>dominant talents</strong> naturally appear frequently and powerfully. Almost no matter where you are or what you are doing, your dominant talents are active.</li>
  <li>Your <strong>supporting talents</strong> naturally surface only when their support is needed, and do so with only relative power. Because they aren’t as powerful, your supporting talents are unlikely to serve as a foundation for strengths development.</li>
  <li>Your <strong>lesser talents</strong> naturally appear rarely, and they offer little power. Because of that minimal power, lesser talents seldom contribute to strengths development.</li>
</ul>

<p>As Lee Saville (1608-BE) once said (and this is a paraphrase), strengths development is like looking at a landscape – there are mountains, valleys, plateaus. We have access to all of our strengths, but they might be in different stages of development at a given time.</p>

<h3 id="developing-your-strengths">Developing Your Strengths</h3>
<p>To develop your strengths, start by looking at the top 5 talent themes that came up for you in your StrengthsFinder assessment. Which of them best describe your greatest talents — the ways in which you most consistently and productively think, feel, and behave?</p>

<p>These top 5 themes will be great resources for you as you work to understand your talents. These results were generated from your spontaneous, top-of-mind reactions to the paired descriptors presented by the Clifton StrengthsFinder, and <em>your spontaneous reactions to situations you encounter are the best indicators of your talents.</em></p>

<p>As you think about how to develop your strengths, consider these other areas that will help you refine your talents:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Passions</strong> can reveal the presence of a talent, particularly when they are felt early in life. A passion can be described as an internal force, an almost magnetic attraction, that leads you to a particular activity or environment time and again.</li>
  <li><strong>Rapid learning</strong> reveals other traces of talent. In the context of a new challenge or a new environment (such as Turing), something sparks your talents. Immediately your brain seems to light up as if a whole bank of switches were suddenly flicked to “on” — and the speed at which you anticipate the steps of a new activity, acquire a new skill, or gain new knowledge provides a telltale clue to the talent’s presence and power.</li>
  <li><strong>Satisfaction</strong> is psychological fulfillment that results when you take on and successfully meet challenges that engage your greatest talents. Pay close attention to the situations that energize you the most. Through identifying them, you will be able to pinpoint some of your dominant talents.</li>
  <li><strong>Timelessness</strong> also can serve as a clue to talent. If you have ever become so engrossed in an activity that you lost all track of time, it may have been because the activity engaged you at a deep, natural level — the level of great talent.</li>
  <li><strong>Glimpses of excellence</strong> are flashes of outstanding performance that have been observed by you or others. In these moments, the task at hand has tapped some of your greatest talents and directly displayed your potential for strength.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using your StrengthsFinder results will help you gather clues to identify your most powerful talents and develop your strengths as you learn new skills and prepare to transition careers.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-strengthsfinder-results">How to Use StrengthsFinder Results</h2>
<p>Now that you have taken the StrengthsFinder assessment, let’s dive into what the results mean. After taking the assessment, you were given your top 5 talent themes as well as a few PDF documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Signature Theme Report: This doc contains definitions of how the StrengthsFinder team defines your top 5 themes</li>
  <li>Strengths Insight Report: This doc gives personalized insights for you based on your results.</li>
  <li>Strengths Insight and Action-Planning Guide: Along with insights, this document gives suggestions for action steps you could take to develop these talents more.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="i-do">I Do</h3>
<p>Allison will model how she would reflect on her results:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strategic</li>
  <li>Empathy</li>
  <li>Intellection</li>
  <li>Developer</li>
  <li>Input</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Discover the meaning of a talent theme:
    <ul>
      <li>How does StrengthsFinder define these themes?</li>
      <li>What does the personalized definition mean to me?</li>
      <li>What words or phrases stick out to me?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reflect: when have I seen myself doing this?
    <ul>
      <li>How do I use this talent already?</li>
      <li>Are there ways I might not be aware of this talent?</li>
      <li>When has this talent been helpful for me?</li>
      <li>When have I seen this talent get in my way?</li>
      <li>How do I feel about the level to which I use this talent on a regular basis?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Goal-setting: how would I like to develop this theme more?
    <ul>
      <li>How could this theme be useful at Turing? In programming?</li>
      <li>How can I build more awareness around this theme?</li>
      <li>In which situations would developing this theme be very beneficial?</li>
      <li>How do I want others to see me in regards to this theme?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Look at suggestions for action and consider options:
    <ul>
      <li>What option(s) sound the most doable?</li>
      <li>What are some new ways to use this theme that I hadn’t considered before?</li>
      <li>What obstacles are there to trying these options?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Turn options into action steps:
    <ul>
      <li>What one action step do I want to commit to in order to help me with my goals?</li>
      <li>How can I maximize my time to ensure that I complete this action step?</li>
      <li>How will I know that I’ve successfully completed this action step?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Example from Allison:<br />
 * What are some synonyms for each of these themes?<br />
      * Strategic = detail-oriented<br />
      * Empathy = observant<br />
      * Intellection = introspective<br />
      * Developer = coach<br />
      * Input = curious<br />
  * How do I see myself using these strengths?<br />
      * Strategic = create thorough plans<br />
      * Empathy = give support<br />
      * Intellection = consider multiple perspectives<br />
      * Developer = provide motivation and resources<br />
      * Input = base decisions in facts<br />
  * When would I want to tone down my strengths?<br />
  * How could I grow in my strengths?</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-know-each-other-through-strengths">Getting to Know Each Other Through Strengths</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Using just the Signature Themes Report (the report with the 5 definitions on it), familiarize yourself with how StrengthsFinder defines your top 5 themes and then answer these questions from the <a href="https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/edit/master/module_one/strengths_reflection_guidelines.md">template</a> in your own copy that you’ll put in a gist:
    <ul>
      <li>What words or phrases stick out to you for each theme?</li>
      <li>How would you define each of your top 5 talents in your own words?</li>
      <li>Do these top 5 talent themes resonate with you? Why or why not?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fill in your top 5 on the cohort chart that your instructor will post in your channel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Find a group of 4 and introduce your top 5 themes</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>What do your top 5 strengths mean to you? How do they describe you?</li>
  <li>When have you seen yourself using these strengths in your life/work experience?</li>
  <li>If anyone in the group has strength(s) in common, how is your understanding of the strength the same? How does it differ?</li>
  <li>How could your group learn from each other’s strengths?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Whole Group Debrief:</strong> How did it feel to talk about yourself? Volunteers discuss what their strengths mean and how they’ve seen themselves using them.</p>

<h2 id="further-reflection">Further Reflection</h2>
<p>Using the other two reports, take time to individually reflect on the results and begin to make both short-term and longterm goals for both Turing and your new career path using your strengths. Answer the rest of the questions on the <a href="/module_one/strengths_reflection_guidelines.md">template</a> in your own gist.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps--coaching">Next Steps &amp; Coaching</h2>
<p>StrengthsFinder will be a helpful tool we’ll use throughout your career development sessions at Turing. If you would like support in building your strengths individually or just want someone to talk with about your goals or how to be successful at Turing, please reach out to Allison to set up a 1-on-1 meeting.</p>

<p>Participating in coaching is completely optional, and even if you don’t want to participate in coaching this module, you can participate at any point during your time at Turing.</p>

<p><strong>What is professional coaching?</strong></p>

<p>Coaching can be a helpful tool as students work to realize their own value both as a professional and as an individual as it provides a framework for students to develop themselves to their fullest potential. As a coach, Allison works to get to know students as individuals, helping to uncover their core values, strengths, and passions through discussion, guidance, and reflection. She acts as a thought partner in these discussions. Through coaching, students are able to cultivate a stronger sense of self, which leads them to achieving peak performance in both personal and professional goals.</p>

<p>All coaching sessions are confidential.</p>
