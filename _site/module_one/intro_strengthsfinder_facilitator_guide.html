    <p>Students will create gists for their reflections using this <a href="https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/edit/master/module_one/strengths_reflection_guidelines.md">template</a>. <strong>Note:</strong> they should NOT edit the template itself. Repeating students have specific questions to answer midway down the template.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Length: 60 minutes</p>

<ul>
  <li>Opening (5 mins)</li>
  <li>Overview: what is a strength, etc. (10 mins)</li>
  <li>I Do: Demonstrate how to interpret reports (10 mins)</li>
  <li>We Do: Get to know each other through strengths (15 mins)</li>
  <li>You Do: Individual Reflections (18 mins)</li>
  <li>Closing: Recap use of StrengthsFinder and option for coaching (2 mins)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="before-the-session">Before the Session</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Review your strengths and reports before the session to be ready to share them with the class. You’ll want to update Slide 12 with your own strengths.</li>
  <li>You’ll also want to update Slide 22 with guidelines for how Ellen Mary would like to run coaching/support sessions with students.</li>
  <li>Create a spreadsheet by making a copy of <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/casimircreative.com/spreadsheets/d/1sTqhaRG-25nTau3gqkSPHZ9YQkfBejCEXyNgyEylXK4/edit?usp=sharing">this one</a> and adding in the roster for the cohort to use in the session.</li>

After 5 minutes, switch to Slide 20 and say: <strong>“Now we’ll do 3 rounds of speed dating to get to know each other by introducing ourselves using our top 5 StrengthsFinder themes.”</strong> Tell students to find a partner and use the questions on the slide to direct their conversations.
