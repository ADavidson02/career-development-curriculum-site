* Power of Self-Reflection
* Social Identity Mapping
* Values Mapping
* Workview & Lifeview

### Importance of Self-Reflection
Throughout career development at Turing, you'll continue to be challenged to reflect in ways you might not have previously. Your career journal will ask you to think about yourself and your goals using various questions that might be new to you. This is how you grow and make progress.

Take 5-7 minutes to read through [this post on the power of self-reflection](https://medium.com/publishous/the-power-of-self-reflection-c1a654ea03a)

Here's [another, longer article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/importance-self-reflection-part-2/) that provides some additional insight into the importance of self-reflection as it relates to work and working relationships. 

Your first journal prompt this week will ask you to consider what is challenging about self-reflection and how you can continue to build it as a habit while at Turing.

### Building a Compass
The following ideas come from the book [Designing Your Life](https://bookshop.org/books/designing-your-life-how-to-build-a-well-lived-joyful-life/9781101875322)

When you're undergoing a big life change, such as a career change, it's easy to get bogged down in all the details and numerous questions that come up about our lives -- "What do I want in life? How will I find it? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do?" Those questions can sometimes lead to analysis paralysis, and it's hard for us to move forward. So, instead of trying to answer *all* the questions at once, we're going to start with a framework -- we're going to build a compass.

You're probably familiar with a compass. It's a navigational device that allows the user to understand their own direction as it relates to the cardinal directions, most notably aligning with magnetic north. Using a compass helps us orient ourselves and figure out what direction we need to head in next to make it to our destination. 

To create your "true north," we're going to utilize a few different tools that will help you understand yourself better when it comes to your identity, values, and what the book calls "workview" and "lifeview" -- the ways in which you define what work and life are to you. 

In summary, building a compass will allow you to move from the dysfunctional belief of **"I should already know where I'm going,"** which is a fixed mindset approach to understanding your goals to **"I won't always know where I'm going, but I can always know whether I'm going in the right direction."** Throughout Turing and your job search, come back to your compass to help you understand if your actions are aligned with what's important to you in your new career. When they are, you are absolutely on the right track!
