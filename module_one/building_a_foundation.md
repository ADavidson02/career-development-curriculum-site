### Overview of Professional Development at Turing
**Facilitator #1:**

On Slides 3-8, go through the following:

#### The What
Turing’s **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.

Turing’s career development curriculum is created directly out of this mission with a focus on **unlocking students’ potential** in modules 1 and 2 through cultivating self-awareness and empathy. In modules 3 and 4, curriculum focuses on providing strategies to empower students to **succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers** by creating connections within the technology industry, building competencies for industry leadership, and securing a fulfilling career -- and not just another job.

The touchstones of this curriculum include these mindsets:

* **Agency:** Taking initiative and ownership over your learning and work
* **Empathy:** Understanding and sharing others' emotions in order to better connect and work with them
* **Engagement:** Active participation in community
* **Grit:** A combination of perseverance and passion
* **Growth:** A belief that your abilities can be developed through dedication, hard work, and resiliency

#### The How
How are we actually going to do this?
* Focus on professional skills:
  * Communication
  * Building teams
  * Agile practices
* Focus on job readiness:
  * Outreach & Networking
  * Resumes
  * Cover Letters
  * Interview Skills

Through all of these, we aim for students to develop a **self-awareness** that allows them to speak to their strengths and build connections with developers and others in this industry.

#### Right Now
Today, we're going to start building this self-awareness by talking through our strengths.

### Objectives
* Identify the strengths and working preferences you came to Turing with
* Understand process and tools to aid in your professional development
* Understand how to build awareness around different strengths and when to dial them back
* Analyze your possibilities for professional growth

### Overview of Strengths & Working Styles
**Facilitator #2**

On Slides 9-14, go through the following:

A strength is defined as a combination of skills, knowledge, and talents. Let's go back to the reflection you submitted in your Mod 0 Capstone:

* What do you do best?
* How do you like to work?
* How do you use your strengths?

*All of these questions will come in handy when interviewing*

**Facilitator #2 call on students:**
* Whole Group: On a fist to five, how easy was it for you to answer these questions?
* Cold call on 1-2 students: How did you know the answers to these questions?
*Potential answers: "I know I like to work by myself"; "I am really good at multi-tasking"; "I like to talk to people and bounce ideas off of them."*

As we start to dive deeper into our strengths and working preferences, let's examine what this can look like in action:

**Note to Facilitator #2:** The following examples could be discussed in a whole group discussion with cold calling using popsicle sticks or in a turn & talk.

**Example #1:** Jason prefers to spend time thinking through problems in his head and drawing out solutions before discussing them.

* How does this person work best?
* What is this working style called?
  * This is on the introversion spectrum. Introversion and extroversion are about how we gain energy. How does an extrovert gain energy?
* What is a strength of this working style?
* What should Jason and any teammates he works with be aware of?

**Example #2:** Ana enjoys being challenged and working hard. She doesn't feel like her day is complete if she hasn't accomplished something. She is very motivated by the satisfaction of meeting deadlines, and she doesn't feel like her day is complete if she hasn't accomplished something.

* How would you describe Ana's strengths?
* What should Ana and any teammates she works with be aware of?

**Example #3:** Sam doesn't like conflict. When working in teams, Sam will often take the role of the mediator, listening to all members' ideas and contributing to a plan that represents a consensus. They don't work as well when they're pushed to take a side.

* How would you describe Sam's strengths?
* What should Sam and any teammates they work with be aware of?

**Facilitator #1:**

On Slides 15-26, as you go through the following about Pairin, feel free to talk about your own results with the questions after each of the top 4 qualities. Allison has also included her Top 4 to serve as an example:

### Tool for Understanding Our Strengths: The Pairin Survey
If you're having trouble answering the above questions, your Pairin survey results might be able to help you. Pairin is a tool that gives you insight into 102 **coachable** and **changeable** professional skills ranging from citizenship to empathy to self awareness. The results from your survey will help you to identify some of your strengths and potential areas for growth.

#### Understanding the Results: Overview of Top 4 Qualities
Your results show you top 4 qualities:

1. Top Thinking Style
2. Most Intense Driver
3. Highest EQ Competency
4. Leading Virtue Class

The following information comes from the [Pairin Qualities Overview](/files/Pairin%20Top%20Qualities%20Overview.pdf)

#### Thinking Styles
The Thinking Styles are characteristic ways of processing information and handling tasks. This includes how people acquire knowledge, organize thoughts, form views and opinions, apply personal value, plan, decide, solve problems, and express themselves. Thinking styles are NOT the same thing as thinking ability. These are categorized in 4 areas:

* Cooperative-Practical: Team Player
* Imaginative-Inspirational
* Intuitive-Conceptual
* Objective-Analytical

**Facilitator #1 or Facilitator #2, share with the whole group:**
* My top thinking style is... I've seen it in action when...
* Here's how that's a strength...

#### Drivers
Psychologist Henry Murray outlined a set of psychological needs that—-alone or in combination—-drive specific behaviors. Murray believed that everyone has the same set of needs but that individuals experience them in different intensities. These Drivers are based on Murray’s needs. The three domains (Love, Work & Growth) are derived from the core concepts of Abraham Maslow, Edgar Schein and James Sales.

* **Love** — *to interact, connect with &  experience care for and from others*
   * Relationship: Friend
   * Supportiveness: Caregiver
   * Flamboyance: Stand-out
   * Deference: Loyalist
   * Support-Seeking: Reliant

* **Work** — *to influence outcomes & gain mastery*
   * Achievement: Ace Achiever
   * Personal Power: Director
   * Persistence: Tug Boat
   * Order: Specialist
   * Aggressiveness: Blaze

* **Growth** — *to be all that I can be in life; fulfilled purpose & potential*
   * Change: Transformer
   * Independence: Maverick
   * Perceptivity: Searcher
   * Vitality: Enthusiast
   * Self-Blame: Microscope

**Facilitator #1 or Facilitator #2, share with the whole group:**
* My most intense driver is... which means...
* Here's how that's a strength...

#### Emotional Intelligence (EQ) Competencies
The definition of Emotional Intelligence or EQ (first advanced by researchers Peter Salavoy and John Mayer, but popularized by author Daniel Goleman) is the ability to:

* Recognize, understand and manage our own emotions
* Recognize, understand and influence the emotions of others

In practical terms, developing EQ means gaining awareness that emotions drive our behavior and impact people (positively and negatively) and learning to manage those emotions — both our own and others — especially when we are under pressure. The EQ framework has four categories comprising 18 competencies as outlined below.

* Self-Awareness
  * Emotional Self-Awareness: Self-Attuned
  * Self-Assessment:	Self-Examiner
  * Self-Confidence:	Self-Confident

* Self-Management
  * Self-Control: Calm, Cool, Collected
  * Transparency: Glass Window
  * Achievement: Ace Achiever
  * Initiative: Self-Starter
  * Optimism: Can Do Attitude
  * Flexibility & Adaptability:	Elasticity

* Social Awareness
  * Empathy: I “Get” You
  * Organizational Awareness: Group Expert
  * Service Orientation: At Your Service

* Relationship Management  
  * Inspirational Leader: Inspirational Leader
  * Influential Leader: Influential Leader
  * Enriching Others:	People Developer
  * Change:	Transformer
  * Conflict Management: Conflict Wrangler
  * Cooperative-Practical: Team Player

**Facilitator #1 or Facilitator #2, share with the whole group:**
* My highest EQ competency is... I've seen myself use it in this way...
* Here's how that's a strength...

#### Virtue Classes
Six broad virtues classifying 24 specific strengths that consistently emerge as “good” across history and culture. Pairin’s virtues map to Character Strengths and Virtues (Peterson, C., & Seligman, M. E. P., 2004), the work of a prestigious group of researchers who have attempted to create a systematic classification and measurement of widely valued positive traits. Their aim was to present a measure of humanist ideals of virtue in an empirical and scientific way.  

Knowing your leading virtue class and associated strengths isn’t just interesting information. Research shows that tapping into character strengths can help an individual to: 1) Buffer against, manage and overcome problems, 2) Improve relationships, and 3) Enhance health and overall well-being.

* Courage: Lover of Courage
* Humanity: Lover of Humanity
* Justice: Lover of Justice
* Transcendence:	Lover of Transcendence
* Wisdom & Knowledge:	Lover of Wisdom
* Temperance:	Lover of Moderation

**Facilitator #1 or Facilitator #2, share with the whole group:**
* My highest virtue class is... which means...
* Knowing that helps me....

**Facilitator #2:**

Using Slide 27, cold call on students to discuss the cohort's top 4:

* What do you notice about these top 4?
* How are each of these qualities *strengths*? What would they look like in action?

### Results Reflections
**Facilitator #2:** Using Slide 28, instruct students to take 10 minutes to go over their top 4 qualities and answer these questions in their journals:

* In your own words, what do these top 4 qualities tell you about yourself?
* Do they resonate with you? Why/why not?
* What do these top 4 qualities make you think about as you embark on Turing and your new career as a software developer?

### Small Group Discussions
**Facilitator #2:** Using slide 29, have students get into small groups of 3-4 people to discuss:

* Share your top 4 qualities from the survey OR your answers from the opening reflection.
* If you were in a team together, how would you describe your ability to work together?
* What would you need to be aware of when working with people who have different strengths from you?

**Note to Facilitators:** During the discussion, please circulate the room.

### Closing Out
**Facilitator #1:** Using slide 31, cold call on a few students to share takeaways from the session:

* What are you taking away from today’s session?
* What would it take for you to build more awareness of your strengths?
* What would you like to focus on in your professional development at Turing?

Reminder that if you would like customized coaching, reach out to Allison to schedule a 1:1 meeting.
