# PD Plan for Repeating Module 1

Repeating the module is an opportunity to not only solidify technical skills but also take advantage of extra time to work on your professional development and take concrete steps for your job search. 



As you make your plan here, think about how you can push yourself to grow in these areas further.

### Sessions
You are not required to attend any of the professional development sessions you have attended previously. But you may choose to attend them to 



### Career Journal
You should create a new section of your career journal and title it "Mod 1 Repeat."
