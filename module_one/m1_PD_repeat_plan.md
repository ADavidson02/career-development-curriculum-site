title: PD Plan for Repeating Module 1
---

Repeating the module is an opportunity to not only solidify technical skills but also take advantage of extra time to work on your professional development and take concrete steps for your job search.

Reminder that in Mod 1, we covered the topics of:

* Self-awareness
* Self-reflection
* Identify and build an understanding of one's strengths, values, and social identity
* Identify effective and ineffective habits
* Creation of a career vision

As you make your plan here, think about how you can push yourself to grow in these areas further.

Here's the breakdown of expectations for repeating the module:

### Sessions
You are **not** required to attend any of the professional development sessions you have attended previously. If you choose to attend any sessions, please plan to fully participate in activities, including breakout group discussions. Reminder of the weekly sessions:

* Week 1: [Understanding Your Strengths](/module_one/week_1_understanding_your_strengths)
* Week 2: [Building Your Compass: Identity, Values, and Goals](/module_one/week_2_building_your_compass)
* Week 3: [Building Habits to Become a Software Developer](/module_one/week_3_building_habits)
* Week 4: [Creating Your Career Vision, Part I](/module_one/week_4_career_vision_part_i)
* Week 5: [Creating Your Career Vision, Part II](/module_one/week_5_career_vision_part_ii)

### Career Journal
1. Please create a new section of your career journal and title it "Mod 1 Repeat Journal Reflections." We recommend [using this template to organize your responses](/career_journals/career_journal_template).
2. For this module, you should consider 1-2 goals you want to work on and track your progress towards those goals. What should these goals look like? Whatever will be most helpful for your professional growth this module. Here are some examples:
  * Organization & time management
  * Communication
  * Project & priority management
  * Stress management
  * Take on a leadership role within your cohort through organizing study groups, leading a review session for the class, assist SLC reps in facilitating cohort retros, organizing a non-coding social activity, etc.
  * Participate in an activity related to your new career outside of Turing (i.e., attend a meetup, network with an alum, research companies you're interested in, etc.)
  * Write a blog post about something you're learning
