  * Your Pairin themes
  * How you've seen yourself grow during this module at Turing

* **Why are you here?** Consider describing:
  * When have you struggled at Turing? How have you dealt with struggle?
  * When have you succeeded at Turing? How did you accomplish those successes?

* **What's next?** Consider describing:
