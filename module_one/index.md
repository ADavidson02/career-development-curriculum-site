## Module 1 Overview
Module 1 Career Development is focused on the **Discovery** phase, which encourages students to focus on answering the questions of "Why am I here? What do I want in this career? What strengths, habits, and abilities do I have to help me get there? What should I develop to help me further?" Students will engage in discovery through weekly workshops, discussions, and continuous self-reflection in their career journals.  

### Key Learning Goals
Core Competencies of Module 1:
* Self-awareness
* Self-reflection
* Identify and build an understanding of one's strengths, values, and social identity
* Identify helpful and unhelpful habits
* Creation of a career vision

### Module 1 Outcomes
At the end of Module 1, students will have a working vision statement for their career. In Module 2, they will build on this to create a professional story, professional brand, and working job search strategy.

### Career Journal
Students will engage in self-reflection and ideation in their career journals every week during a module. 

**What is a career journal?** The journal will help guide you through the process of discovering who you are as a new developer and how that translates into your career goals.  It’s a way to check in with yourself through self-reflection, prompts, and questions, organize your targeted job search, and remember who you met as you build a professional network.   
* **Make it your own.** Add questions and areas to reflect on each week. Just don’t forget to share all of your successes and achievements along the way! 
* **Ongoing progress checks.** Throughout each module, you'll respond to the other prompts and update your progress in your document during professional development workshops and set aside work time. 
* **Module Expectations.** A completed career journal is required for successfully passing each module. The career development team will be assessing your progress throughout the module, and you will submit it for final review in week 6. You will also include highlights from your progress in your end of module portfolio presentation. 

#### Set Up
Students will create their career journals in Mod 0 and submit them as part of their career development prework. [Here is the Module 1 set of career journal prompts.](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/module_one/mod1_career_journal_prompts.md)

### Repeating the Module
For students repeating Module 1, they are not required to attend workshops again unless they would like to. They should continue to further their career development goals throughout the module, [following these guidelines and prompts for their career journals](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/module_one/m1_PD_repeat_plan.md). The Career Development team will check in with repeating students to provide guidance and answer questions.
