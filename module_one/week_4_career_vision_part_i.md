### Learning Goals
* Understand design thinking principles and mindsets
* Apply design thinking to formulating your understanding of your career vision
* Create ideas for your career vision 

### [This Week's Career Journal Prompts](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/module_one/mod1_career_journal_prompts.md#week-4)
* Habits Reflection
* Start where you are
* Define your needs, problems, and insights
* Ideate: challenge assumptions
* Prototype: start creating solutions
* Test: create your career vision draft

### Overview
Ideas here are adapted from [Designing Your Life](https://bookshop.org/books/designing-your-life-how-to-build-a-well-lived-joyful-life/9781101875322)

This week we're going to discuss how design thinking principles can be applied to your career development to help you discover your career vision.

Let's start by first asking yourself this question: Why did you decide to pursue software development and come to Turing?

You might have a lot of answers that initially come to mind, and they probably all boil down to one thing: you weren't happy. In whatever you were doing before this, you weren't fulfilled, whether it was financially, intellectually, or otherwise. And in design thinking, this comes down to recognizing there is a problem and that we now need to seek a solution. Your solution goes from "what do I want to do?" to "who or what do I want to grow into?" 

[Last week](/module_one/week_3_building_habits), you discussed that **your goal is to become a software developer**. Now, we have to design a solution to get there. 

First, let's debunk a popular myth: if you know what you're passionate about, you'll be able to create a clear vision for your career. But the truth is that [as many as 80% of people don't know exactly what they're passionate about as discovered by William Damon, director of the Stanford Center on Adolescence](https://bookshop.org/books/the-path-to-purpose-how-young-people-find-their-calling-in-life/9781416537243). Passion is not a finite idea that just exists. Instead, it's something that can be developed. In fact, through design thinking principles, we can develop that passion here at Turing.

“A well-designed career is a career that is generative--it is constantly creative, productive, changing, evolving, and there is always the possibility of surprise.” -[Designing Your Life](https://bookshop.org/books/designing-your-life-how-to-build-a-well-lived-joyful-life/9781101875322).

### Design Thinking
Design Thinking refers to 


Steps when used in product development (not necessarily in this order; this is a fluid process):
Empathize – with your users
Define – your users’ needs, their problem, and your insights
Ideate – by challenging assumptions and creating ideas for innovative solutions
Prototype – to start creating solutions
Test – solutions
Developing 5 mindsets:
Curiosity
Bias to action
You can’t have the career you want just by learning to code; you have to push yourself to try new things; sometimes you’ll fail; sometimes you’ll discover something entirely new from what you thought you wanted; that’s part of this process
Reframing
Awareness:
Things will get messy and the path will not always be clear
Radical collaboration
Applying Design Thinking principles to designing your career (providing examples):
Empathize: we have to understand where we currently are in regards to our visions for our career
Define: your own needs, problem, and insights into that problem; define what needs to happen in order to solve it
Ideate: challenge assumptions you might already have about what it takes to get a career in software development and create new ideas to find innovative solutions for yourself
Prototype: you have to try things; this is that bias towards action mindset; you’ll also want to solicit ideas through radical collaboration 
Test: continue to refine your vision; it’s going to be iterative
Start Where You Are 
Dysfunctional Belief: “I should already know where I’m going”
Reframing it: You can’t know where you’re going until you recognize where you are
Build on the work you’ve been doing this mod
