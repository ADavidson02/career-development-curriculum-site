### Design Thinking Overview
This week we're going to discuss how design thinking principles can be applied to your career development to help you discover your career vision.

Let's start by first asking yourself this question: Why did you decide to pursue software development and come to Turing?

You might have a lot of answers that initially come to mind, and they probably all boil down to one thing: you weren't happy. In whatever you were doing before this, you weren't fulfilled, whether it was financially, intellectually, or otherwise. And in design thinking, this comes down to recognizing there is a problem and that we now need to seek a solution. Your solution goes from "what do I want to do?" to "who or what do I want to grow into?" 

[Last week](/module_one/week_3_building_habits), you discussed that **your goal is to become a software developer**. Now, we have to design a solution to get there.
