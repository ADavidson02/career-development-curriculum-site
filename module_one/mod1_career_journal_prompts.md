* [Week 1 Prompts](#week-1)
* [Week 2 Prompts](#week-2)
* [Week 3 Prompts](#week-3)
* [Week 4 Prompts](#week-4)
* [Week 5 Prompts](#week-5)

### Directions
Copy these prompts into your career journal document to complete throughout Mod 1. 

### Mod 1 Week 1: Understanding your strengths <a name="week-1"></a>
1. Describe one of your strengths
* What is something you have learned to do well (list a skill)?
  * I can...
* What is something you know about (list some knowledge/expertise you have)?
  * I know...
* What is something you have a natural ability to do well (list a talent)?
  * I am...
* How could you combine these to describe a specific strength?

2. Read through your Top 4 results from Pairin
* In your own words, what do these top 4 qualities tell you about yourself?
* Do they resonate with you? Why/why not?
* How do they relate to the strength you wrote about in Prompt #1?

3. Challenges with strengths
* What can make it challenging to recognize your strengths? How can you work through those challenges?
* Do you ever see yourself overusing certain strengths? In what circumstances would you want to use them less and amplify other strengths? How could you adjust your approach in those instances?

4. Strengths in action
* Write 1-2 sentences describing how you like to work (i.e., Do you pre-plan? Do you talk through your ideas first? Do you work better with deadlines? How do you stay organized?)
* How could you describe these working preferences to your project teammates? Your mentor? Your instructors?
* What would you need to be aware of when working with people who have different strengths from you?
* How could your Pairin results help you better understand your everyday working preferences?

5. Continued growth
* Is there any particular strength you'd like to sharpen while you're at Turing? Any area you consider a weakness that you'd like to strengthen? 
* What are some steps you could take here?
* How could you be aware of progress you're making?

### Mod 1 Week 2: Building Your Compass <a name="week-2"></a>
1. Power of self-reflection
* What is challenging about self-reflection?
* How can you continue to build the habit of self-reflection at Turing? 

2. Social identity mapping
First, create you own social identity map on a piece of paper (or [print this out](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Social%20Identity%20Map.pdf)):
* Outer ring: write words that describe your given identity
* Middle ring: list aspects of your chosen identity
* Center: write your core attributes—traits, behaviors, beliefs, values, characteristics, and skills that you think make you unique as an individual. Select things that are enduring and key to who you are.

After you complete your map:
* Underline the items that are important to you
* Put a + beside the items that you believe clearly demonstrate that you fit into the tech industry
* Put a - beside the items that you believe do not demonstrate that you fit into the tech industry
* Put a ? beside the items that you're unsure how they could show your ability to contribute to the tech industry

Reflect:
* What does your social identity tell you about what you already bring to the tech industry? 
* What would it look like for some of your minuses or question marks to turn into pluses? In other words, how could some of these traits be assets for the tech industry?

3. Values mapping
Pull out 5 values for each bullet below from [this list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wF1afCu5KqLfDa8rLiOH9ICfIWyjWZRS5Dba7UehYMc/edit?usp=sharing):
* Always valued:
* Often valued:
* Sometimes valued:
* Seldom valued:

Reflect:
* What do these values tell you about yourself? 

4. Workview & Lifeview
* Summarize what good, worthwhile work means to you (Tip: this is NOT about what work you want to do but about why work matters to you):
* Lifeview: summarize what you value in life; what matters to you?
* Where do your views on work and life complement each other?
* Where do they clash?
* Does one drive the other? How?

### Mod 1 Week 3:   <a name="week-3"></a>
1. Self-Reflection:
Reflect on an experience in your paired project:
* What did I experience during the conversation?
• What happened inside me during the conversation?
Reflect on your learning. Analyze your experience and compare to the models or principles that you want to follow.
• What does this experience say to me?
• What can I learn?
Apply to your practice. Apply your learning to your practice. Consider what options you have for the next time you face a similar situation.
• What options do I see for the next time I encounter this situation?
• What specifically do I intend to do based on my reflection?

2. Reflect on Habits

3. Build new Habits

4. Reflect on Accountability systems

5. Build new accountability systems; share them

### Mod 1 Week 4: Creating Your Vision, Part I <a name="week-4"></a>
1. Start Where You Are (Empathize with the user -- *you*):
* Health: how you answer “how are you”; intersection of physical, mental, and emotional health
    * How would you rate your overall health on a scale of 1-5?
    * How do you currently make time for activities associated with your health? 
    * What is a small change you could make here to readjust your health ratings?
* Work: what you do
    * Make a short list of all the ways you work right now
    * How much value do each of those things bring to your life? How are those activities purposeful for you?
* Play: what brings you joy? Think about joy just for the pure sake of doing it; everyone benefits from this kind of play 
    * What activities do you do that bring you joy throughout an average week?
    * In what ways could you make a small change to bring more joy into your life?
* Love: sense of connection; who are the people who matter in your life and how is love flowing to and from you and them?
    * How does love currently show up in your life?
    * How do you show love to others right now?
    * What adjustments would you like to make in this area?
* Looking back at the 4 areas, do any problems emerge that you want to begin designing solutions for?

2. Define your needs, problem, and insights:
* Based on what you wrote about above and your group conversation, what problems have you identified that you'd like to design solutions for?
* What do you already about what you want for your career? What do you still need to find out?
* Who or what do you want to grow into by the end of the Turing program? 

3. Ideate -- challenge assumptions:    
* When you discussed software developers with your small group on Monday, what assumptions came up about what software developers actually do? 
* What steps could you take to challenge those assumptions and find more facts to answer the question of what developers do?
* In addition to what a typical software developer life could look like, what do you want yours to include?

4. Prototype -- start creating solutions:
* What is the basic threshold that your new career must meet after Turing? 
* What would you hope WILL NOT happen in your future after Turing?
* What is your absolute, no-holds-barred, ideal dream for your future after Turing?

5. Test –- solutions:
* Based on this week of reflections, write out your vision statement for your career:

### Mod 1 Week 5: Creating Your Vision, Part II  <a name="week-5"></a>

* What are some habits you could put into place to cultivate beginner's mind regularly?

* Lifeview: summarize what you value in life; what matters to you?
* Where do your views on work and life complement each other?
* Where do they clash?
* Does one drive the other? How?

3. Go through the [Flower Exercise brainstorming worksheets linked here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLe95AA3y8rxnU-MDnyAVeoqWCxE9__KMDhmPgcd_7c/edit?usp=sharing). Then complete your [Flower Exercise final worksheet here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ETSoRT-BxMH-cTWzbk1inRESmYHGnpbz0DgBHgmAJ-4/edit?usp=sharing) and link that finished worksheet here.

4. Write out your top 5 strengths that you've seen in action this module; then write out the strengths of a software developer. Where do you see these lists overlapping? Where are they different?

5. Write a refined vision statement here (what new things have you discovered this week to incorporate into your vision statement?):
