### Opening
You have started to work together in meaningful ways--during class, in pairing sessions, and in partner projects.  That means that we are 100% certain you are about to experience (or already have) a clash in working styles. By discussing how we learn and work best, we can become more aware of these preferences, think about ways that we can better communicate our needs, and compromise in order to bring out the best in everyone.

#### Objectives

* Build self-awareness so that you can develop even more empathy with others
* Understand how we can leverage our different working styles for success at Turing and beyond

#### What Do Introversion and Extroversion Mean, Really?
What comes to mind when you hear the word "introvert"? What comes to mind when you hear the word "extrovert"? What impressions do you already have about these terms?

Read the following [article](https://www.fastcompany.com/3016031/leadership-now/are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert-and-what-it-means-for-your-career) to get a better sense of what these terms mean.

Often we think that introverts are shy and extroverts are outgoing. But in reality, everyone exists on the spectrum of introversion and extroversion, and our place on that spectrum can change depending on our current circumstances.

### Working Styles & Preferences at Turing
On the imaginary line presented by your Facilitator, think about where you fall in the spectrum of introversion and extroversion while at Turing. Many times you can say that your intro/extro/ambiversion might depend on the situation. In this case, we want you to select the place on the spectrum that you are most often in while you are at Turing.  Think about your reactions in class, how you respond to pairing, how you work in group projects.  

### Small Group Discussion #1
With 2-3 people who are standing near you on the line, form a group and grab a piece of chart paper to answer the following questions:

* What does this place on the spectrum mean to you? What does this place on the spectrum look like in practice at Turing?
* What are your strengths in regards to this working style?
* What challenges have you faced because you identify with this working style? Think about challenges in pairing, in class, in community activities.
* How do you think you're perceived by those who don't share this same working style?
* What do you need from other working styles to be at your best?

### Gallery Walk

Now take a walk around the room to read what's been written on the various charts. You should note any new ideas or perspectives that will help you with your own understanding of your working style in your journal.

### Small Group Discussion #2
Now, find another group to discuss these discoveries with each other by finding someone whose preference is on the other side of the spectrum from yours. If you identify as being more introverted, find someone who identifies as being more extroverted. Depending on the size of the cohort and initial preferences, these groups may be 2-4 people.

In your new groups, discuss these questions:  

* Share your dominant working style and what came up in your first discussion and what you learned from the gallery walk
* How could you work with each other to maximize your strengths and also learn from the opposing working style?
* What are areas between these working styles that could cause conflict?
* How could you address these differences in your work?

## Whole Group Share

* What are areas between these working styles that could cause conflict?
* How could you address these differences in your work?

### Individual Reflection
In your notebook, please respond to these two questions.

* What did you hear from people who were opposite ends of the spectrum from you?  What would it require for you to give someone else what they needed to be at their best?
* How can you leverage your place on the spectrum of introversion/extroversion to impact your career in the future?

### Closing
Make sure to share your reflections with your partner in your paired project this week.
