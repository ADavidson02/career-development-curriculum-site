# Building Habits to Become a Software Developer

[Slides for the session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BwXUyaDs4Ms9v8i9Iye3I3XnGirTpLgQxOzglAEw_Wc/edit?usp=sharing)

Ideas here come from the book [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://bookshop.org/books/atomic-habits-an-easy-proven-way-to-build-good-habits-break-bad-ones/9780735211292)

### Learning Goals
* Understand the role of habits in changing careers to become a software developer
* Understand how to reframe your approach to habits to be identity-driven
* Develop awareness of your current habits
* Create an implementation intention to build a new habit

### [This Week's Career Journal](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/module_one/mod1_career_journal_prompts.md#week-3)
* Identifying habits of a software developer
* Working on the 1st Law of Behavior Change: Make it Obvious
* Set Implementation Intentions

### Connections
In the past two weeks, you’ve reflected on your strengths, identity, and values. Today we’re going to connect that reflective work to habits because our identity informs our habits (and vice versa).

When we says habits, we're talking about:

* A routine or behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic
* Purpose of habits is to solve problems with as little energy or effort as possible
* The habits we utilize are synonymous with our identity

### Our Identity = Our Habits
When we say that our identities inform our habits, we mean:

* Behavior (habits) that aren’t aligned with our identity won’t last
* Cultivating new behavior (habits) means cultivating new parts of our identities
* Changing unhelpful/unproductive behavior (habits) means letting go of parts of our identities

Consider the habits you utilize currently. Which are you proud of? What do they say about you? 

Conversely, are there any habits you have that don't reflect the person you want to be? Do you want to break them or replace them with better habits?

### Putting This Into Practice
Read this 5-min article by James Clear on [Identity-Based Habits](https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits).

Takeaways:
* The habits you put into place become your identity
* Go from “I want this” to “I *am* this”

Since your goal is to become a software developer, this means cultivating the identity of a software developer in your regular habits. How to do this:

* Analyzing your current habits
* Continuously editing your beliefs
* Expanding your identity

### Goals vs. Systems
Something that may sound counterintuitive is that we'll focus more on building *systems* than in trying to achieve *goals.* Why is this?

* Goals are focused on the results you want to achieve; they are a one-off achievement
* Systems are the processes to get there; they are ongoing

Goals are restrictive and conditional:
  * "When I get to the next module, I'll be happy"
  * "When I get a new job, I'll be happy"

It's important to start by redesigning your goal. It's not to learn to code; it's to **become** a software a developer. And in order to that, you have to develop ongoing successful processes.

**Do Now:** The first 2 prompts in [this week's career journal](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/module_one/mod1_career_journal_prompts.md#week-3) asks you to consider what the traits and behaviors of a good software developer are.
