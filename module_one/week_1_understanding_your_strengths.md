### Prior to the Session
* Log back into [Pairin](https://auth.pairin.com/auth/signin?continue=https://app.pairin.com) to access your Pairin results
* Download and save your results as a PDF to have your results more handy

### Learning Goals
* Understand what a strength is and what it can look like in practice
* Identify your own top strengths both in reflection and by using your Pairin results
* Identify challenges with using your strengths
* Plan for how to discuss strengths and working preferences
* Analyze opportunities for professional growth

### [This Week's Career Journal](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/module_one/mod1_career_journal_prompts.md#week-1)
* Describe one of your strengths
* Reflect on Pairin Top 4
* Challenges with Strengths
* Strengths in Action
* Continued growth

### Strengths: Why are we starting here?
The core of developing yourself professionally is *understanding yourself* and  *being able to speak to to that understanding.* You have to understand yourself in order to know what you're striving towards professionally as well as how to advocate for what you want. 

These abilities will not only help you at Turing but in your new career as a software developer.

## Overview
This week's focus is on strengths. It can be easier said than done to identify what our strengths are. So, to help us break them down, we can think about them about our strengths as a combination of:

* Skills
* Knowledge
* Talents

**Skills** are something you have *learned* to do well
  * A way to articulate this is by using a statement starting with "I can..."

**Knowledge** is something you know or have expertise in from years of study and practice
  * A way to articulate this is by using a statement starting with "I know..."
  
**Talent** refers to something that you have a *natural ability* to do well. Another way to think about it is something you were born with and have a natural preference towards.
  * A way to articulate this is by using a statement starting with "I am..."
  
Seems easy enough, right?

Again, breaking down our strengths can be difficult, so let's start with looking at some examples.

#### Example #1
You heard from our executive director, Jeff Casimir, this morning at the State of Turing talk. Often when people hear him speak, they remark on how passionate he is. Why is that? Let's break it down:

* Here his **skill** relates to his *public speaking* abilities. Jeff has honed those over the years in conference talks, on panels, in podcasts, and in speaking with students and stakeholders throughout the years at Turing.

* His **knowledge** can often be summed up by his "big ideas" (his words). He is a prolific reader, especially around topics of organizational leadership and best practices for schools and organizations interested in social change. He creates connections between these ideas in his blog posts and speeches. 

* Now that brings us to his **talent,** which in this context relates to his ability to *engage and connect with others*. He's a connector and educator.

* Combining these 3 things leads us to the **strength** known as **Inspirational Leadership,** which is defined as the ability to uplift, enliven, fill, and empower people with a compelling vision. As the founder of several programs, Jeff has cultivated and used this strength to not only further his vision but get others involved in executing it as well. 

#### Example #2
Let's look at another strength. A common strength that comes up for students in the Pairin assessment is **Persistence,** which is defined as the drive to firmly continue in a course of action, despite difficulties, opposition, or warning; stubborn determination. Pairin loves to nickname its strengths with fun names, and its reports refer to this one as "Tugboat." What does it look like in practice to be a tugboat?

* A **skill** that would contribute to this is *detail-oriented planning.* If you're someone who uses a planner, likes to write to-do lists, and approaches projects from a backwards planning stance, this might describe you!

* The **knowledge** needed here would be around knowing *how to prioritize,* which comes down to the ability to know which task to focus on at a time based on practice.

* The natural **talent** that might come into play here is the ability to *maintain focus* during arduous tasks. 

Put together, these create the strength of persistence.

### Putting this into Practice: Working Preferences
Breaking down strengths in this way can be easier when we already know what the strength is, but how can you approach recognizing your strengths in everyday activities?

Start by thinking about *how you prefer to work.* Consider these scenarios:

1. Sam prefers to spend time thinking through problems in their head and drawing out solutions before discussing them. 
2. Ana enjoys being challenged and working hard. She doesn't feel like her day is complete if she hasn't accomplished something. She is very motivated by the satisfaction of meeting deadlines.

Based on how they like to work, how would you describe Sam and Anaâ€™s strengths? 

**Do Now:** The first prompt in [this week's career journal](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/module_one/mod1_career_journal_prompts.md#week-1) will ask you to think about what you skills, knowledge, and talents you combine into one of your strengths.
