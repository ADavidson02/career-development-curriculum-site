## Workshop, 30-40 minutes

Open the following Google Spreadsheet and make a copy for yourself. Follow the instructions on the "Intro" tab.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wd4Yvz0GCKi-ktUUdD76SuBFq-cSFnkjfYwPaPBpF5E/edit#gid=0

Use the search tools in those previous Career Development curriculum notes that you opened in other tabs. Refer to these often as you're researching companies.

## ALWAYS ASK YOURSELF: "AM I OKAY WITH THIS?"

It's easy to have grand ideas about where we'd like to work, but we really need to research those companies.

Maybe during your research you'll find that that particular industry is so competitive that the salaries are lower because so many people want that kind of job (ie, gaming).

Maybe you find that a particular industry you're passionate about has most companies working in an area of the country where you'd rather not live (weather, too far from family, etc)

Maybe a particular industry harbors more toxicity in the workplace than others.

Maybe, once you drill down into companies, you find that a company's biggest clients are companies or corporations with whom you might not want to associate. What if your dream job signed up "Big Tobacco" as their #1 client -- are you okay with this?

As passionate as you might be about the job, you DO need to ask yourself these hard questions.

# OUTCOME

Fill out everything you can find online from LinkedIn, blog articles, Google searches, etc. Leave gaps where you can't find information.

Keep track of your progress in your career journal, talk to the careers team about things that stand out as being important to you for your job search.
