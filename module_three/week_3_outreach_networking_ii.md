Step #4 reflects the part where you'll focus on your resume and cover letter. Reminder of best practices for those:

#### Resume Highlights
* Your resume should be a direct reflection of the strategy you’re using in the job search
* Technical Resumes lead with projects
* Customizing your resume is about telling your story

#### Cover Letter Highlights
* Your cover letter should be the direct result of the research you’ve done into the company
* Cover letters are about the company; talk about yourself only in relation to the company
* Always customize your cover letters
* Tell your story in a concise way -- utilize an elevator pitch

#### Where You Should Be at This Point in the Mod
You should have:
  * A working draft of your resume & used CV Compiler
  * Had a peer review on a cover letter
