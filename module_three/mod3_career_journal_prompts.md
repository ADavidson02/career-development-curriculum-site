Based on your latest version of your career vision, list the top 3-5 industries and companies you'll pursue in your job search as of right now. Why did you pick these industries/companies? How do they relate to the values and goals you have for yourself in your job search?

   * Header (Name + Software Developer OR Back End Engineer OR Front End Engineer, etc.)
   * Contact info
   * Summary
   * Skills
