Short answer: yes, you need to write cover letters

Why? This is another opportunity to tell your story

**Slide #7:**

### Hook: Storytelling + Cover Letters

How are cover letters part of storytelling?

Let's go back to this storytelling rule:
* Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.

#### Turn & Talk

* Name a company you admire:
  * What kind of value does it bring to the world?
  * What do you admire about this company?
  * Why would this be a place you’d want to work?

**Note to Facilitator #1:** Call on 1-2 people to share out what they discussed in their turn & talk.

**Facilitator #2:** Using slides #9-15, go through the following:

**Slide #9:**

### Do's & Don't's of a Cover Letter
A cover letter is a place to tell a story and speak to the company, here are some do's and don'ts you should follow:

In a cover letter, you should:

* Demonstrate an understanding of the company
* Introduce yourself...by talking about them
   * What is it that you do that could contribute to what the company does?
   * How would you provide value?
* Create a connection between you and the company
   * What can we do together?
   * It’s not about what you can *get*; it’s about what you can *give*

**Slide #10:**

Here are some things to keep in mind when writing a cover letter:

* There are multiple ways to write an effective cover letter
* The important part is that it’s customized to the company each time
* General rules to follow:
   * Any time you mention yourself connect it explicitly to the job/company
   * Keep it concise (no more than a page; half a page is ideal)
   * If you’ve met someone at the company, drop their name!
   * State the position you’re applying for in the first line

**Slide #11:**

### Back to Storytelling

**Note to Facilitator #2:** Call on 2-3 students to respond to the following questions:

* What are some of the elements we’ve discussed for storytelling?
* How could you use these elements in a cover letter?

Some elements might include: conflict, theme, protagonist's arc or journey, etc.

#### Turn & Talk

You’re now on a Hero’s Journey on a mission to solve the main problem facing the company you admire:

* Describe the skills you bring with you to solve it
* Describe the metrics that would measure your success

**Note to Facilitator #2:** Call on 2-3 students to share out what they discussed

**Slide #12:**

### Other Ways to Incorporate Your Story: The Elevator Pitch

**Note to Facilitator #2:** With the following templates, give an example of how you would structure your own elevator pitch as you talk through these examples:

* Merging my background in X and Y, I help (industry) improve (outcomes).
   * “Merging my background in entrepreneurship and graphic design, I help technology companies improve user engagement and retention with UX Design.”

* Break into parts:
1. Here’s what I did in the previous phase of my career + What I learned…
2. And here’s what I can do for you based on what I’ve learned...

**Slide #13:**

### Examples

In groups, discuss these cover letters as though you're a hiring manager:

* What do you notice about these cover letters?
* What is effective? What value could they bring to the company? How do you know?
* What could be changed to make the letter more effective?

**Slide #14:**

Recap

 * Don’t: use a generic copy

Bonus:

**Slide #15:**

#### Frequently Made Mistakes in Cover Letters

**Mistake:** Very long/wordy cover letters. **Solution:** Shorter paragraphs to be easily skimmable; Cut out extraneous details

**Mistake:** Cover letter is all about you. **Solution:** Only talk about yourself in the context of this job and company to demonstrate how you will provide value. Don’t talk about what you’re hoping to **get** from the company (i.e., mentorship, culture, etc.). The letter should be all about what you’re going to **give** the company as an employee.

**Mistake:** Grammar and spelling errors. **Solution:** Use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) or the [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)

**Facilitator #1:** Using slides #17-24, go through the following:

**Slide #17:**

### We Do

**Note to Facilitator #1:** Using the job posting you picked out earlier, post the job posting in both cohort Slack channels. Students should read the posting to themselves for 1-2 minutes. Then, call on students to help you answer the following questions about the job and company and write these answers on the board:

* What do we notice in the job description that stands out to us?
  * What problem is this company trying to solve?
  * How will this position help solve it?
* What can we pull out to discuss in the cover letter?
* What research should we do?
* How can we use our professional story here?

**Slide #18:**

### Pomodoro

Take a 5-minute break!

**Slide #20:**

### Workshop Time

Form groups of 2-3 people in your program and draft out a cover letter for a position you find as a group.

Remember:

* Use research
* Create relevant connections
* How will you provide value?

**Slide #21:**

### Round of Feedback: Pair & Share

Team up with a group not in your program to share your cover letters and give each other feedback. Feedback should be **specific, actionable, and kind** and include both **appreciation and coaching.**

**Slide #22:**

**Note to Facilitator #1:** There is often not enough time for students to have individual work time on cover letters, so this is just if there is extra time:

### Work Time

Using a position you've added to Huntr, work on a cover letter today using the principles we've discussed.

**Slide #24:**
