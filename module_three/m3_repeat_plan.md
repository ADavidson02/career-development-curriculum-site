title: PD Plan for Repeating Module 3
---

Repeating the module is an opportunity to not only solidify technical skills but also take advantage of extra time to work on your professional development and take concrete steps for your job search.

Reminder that in Mod 3, we covered the topics of:

* Resumes
* Cover letters
* Application process
* Outreach & Networking connected to companies you're applying to
* Interview prep

As you make your plan here, think about how you can push yourself to grow in these areas further.

Here's the breakdown of expectations for repeating the module:

### Sessions
You are **not** required to attend any of the professional development sessions you have attended previously. If you choose to attend any sessions, please plan to fully participate in activities, including breakout group discussions. Reminder of the weekly sessions:

* Week 1: [Professional Storytelling II: Resumes & Portfolios](/module_three/week_1_resumes_and_portfolios) 
* Week 2: [The Application Process](/module_three/week_2_application_process)
* Week 3: [Outreach & Networking II](/module_three/week_3_outreach_networking_ii)
* Week 4: [Interview Prep](/module_three/week_4_interview_prep)
* Week 5: [Refining Your Strategy](/module_three/week_5_refining_your_strategy)

### Career Journal
1. Please create a new section of your career journal and title it "Mod 3 Repeat Journal Reflections." We recommend [using this template to organize your responses](/career_journals/career_journal_template).
2. For this module, you should consider 2-3 goals you want to work on and track your progress towards those goals. What should these goals look like? Whatever will be most helpful for your professional growth this module. Here are some examples:
  * Update your resume and ask your mentor or career dev team member to review it
  * Write a cover letter for a posting that you're interested in; ask mentor or career dev team member to review it
  * Find someone at each company you're interested in and reach out to them; set up a phone call
  * Apply to 1-2 jobs a week (including updating resume, customized cover letter, and outreach for each application)
  * Update your Turing alumni portfolio
  * Attend a networking event, such as an online meetup
  * Update your Huntr with your current job applications
  * Schedule a mock technical or behavioral interview with a mentor
