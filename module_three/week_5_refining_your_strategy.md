### Review: Recognizing Where You Are
Review how youâ€™ve spent your time in the last week. Where are you right now in regards to the deliverables for this mod? What habits are effective for you? What changes should you make in how you spend your time?

Action step: block out the time you need to complete your remaining deliverables this week. Think about what is possible in your schedule and what you need to prioritize.

Also, at this point in the module, it's important to take stock of where you currently are. You've been working on creating lists of companies to target, writing you resume and cover letters, building your portfolio, incorporating outreach and networking into your strategy, and engaging in interview prep. This [week's first journal prompt](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/module_three/mod3_career_journal_prompts.md#week-5) asks you to reflect on what you've accomplished and learned as well as where you might be stuck. Reflect on these pieces to think about what next steps you can take to get unstuck and keep moving forward.
