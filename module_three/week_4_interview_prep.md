### Connecting it all Together
We've been focusing on:

* 


### Opening
Using a fist to five, how was that practice for you? What was difficult about it?

Let's start by thinking about this question: *how well do you know yourself?*

That question is the essence of the non-technical interview. To ace this part of the interview, you want to bring a level of self-awareness to the process so that you can confidently answer any question asked of you.

### Interview Prep Strategies
There are many ways to prepare for interviews. Today, we'll go through 4 particular tips to help with this process:

1. Answer the whole question
2. Tell stories
3. Know how to talk about your experience
4. Research & prep

#### Strategy #1: Answer the whole question**

Pay attention to what the question is asking as well as any *subtext* inherent in the question. Let's look at an example:

* How do you deal with failure?

This question is asking you to:
* **Acknowledge that you fail.** You're not perfect, you have experienced failure. Be upfront and transparent about that
* **Describe what you do after you fail.** How do you pick yourself back up? What next steps do you take?
* **Give specifics.** Even though the way this question is worded doesn't ask for a specific situation, providing specifics helps

**2. Use the [STAR Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result):**

* **Situation:** The interviewer wants you to present a recent challenge and situation in which you found yourself.
* **Task:** What were you required to achieve? The interviewer will be looking to see what you were trying to achieve from the situation. Some performance development methods use “Target” rather than “Task”. Job interview candidates who describe a “Target” they set themselves instead of an externally imposed “Task” emphasize their own intrinsic motivation to perform and to develop their performance.
* **Action:** What did you do? The interviewer will be looking for information on what you did, why you did it, and what the alternatives were.
* **Results:** What was the outcome of your actions? What did you achieve through your actions and did you meet your objectives? What did you learn from this experience and have you used this learning since?

Example:
* Tell me about a successful project that you've worked on.

Let's unpack this using the STAR method.  

**3. Know how to talk about Turing**

* Do:
  * Give a high-level description
  * Talk about Turing as *professional experience*
  * Highlight the differences between Turing and other code schools

* Don't assume your interviewer knows anything about Turing

Example #1:

Instead of saying “In Module 1, when I was working on the Battleship project…” what could you say?

Example #2:

"I’ve never heard of Turing. What did you focus on there? What’s the structure of the program? How did it prepare you for this career?"

**4. Make a list:**

Keep a running doc where you can keep track of common interview questions and specifics that you can draw from to answer these questions.

Brainstorm:
* What other questions might be asked?
* What kinds of examples should you keep track of?

Start this running list in your journal. We'd also recommend that you keep an interview prep-specific journal.

### We Do

1. Take 5 minutes to continue prepping in your journal over some of the common interview questions listed here:

* Why do you want to be a software developer?
* What are your strengths as a developer?
* Describe a successful project that you worked on. What made it a success?
* When have you had to deal with failure? What did you do?
* What is your approach to working on a team?
* What is an area of growth for you?

2. With volunteers, listen to their responses and provide some feedback. Pay attention to:
  * What do you notice about the answer?
  * What do you appreciate about it?
  * What would you do differently?

Whole Group: What else do you notice about the answers given here?

### Group Practice
Get into groups of 3-4 for more practice on these questions. You could also choose to push yourself to answer questions not on the above list. Reminder that feedback should be:

* Specific
* Actionable
* Kind
