[Slides for the session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17sz_0Je9OQfvqQ-NEC3UOMS4wBuKdrhNPqXZVXfP9uc/edit?usp=sharing)

### Learning Goals
* Review and refine your career vision and job search strategy
* Utilize your job search strategy to customize your resume
* Utilize your job search strategy to customize your alumni portfolio

### [This Week's Career Journal Prompts](/module_three/mod3_career_journal_prompts#week-1)
* Refine your career vision and industry list
* Build your resume
* Build your Turing portfolio
* Conduct research on companies of interest

### Overview
Last mod, we spent time defining and revising your career vision based on the values and goals you have for this career. We’ll start here again this module because everything we do in the job search needs to tie back to that career vision. Remember, this is your **compass** -- your vision gives you direction on where to go in your job search, and your strategy should be based on that.

This week's [first prompt in your career journal](/module_three/mod3_career_journal_prompts#week-1) asks you to reflect on this vision and make sure it's still aligned with what you want. 

### Resumes
It's important to know what your career vision is and the strategy you're utilizing to put it into place because these are the foundations for your resume.

* Common misconception: Your resume should be one-size-fits-all
* Reframe: Your resume should be a direct reflection of the strategy you’re using in the job search

#### Technical Resumes Lead with Projects
Since you are a software developer now, your software projects are an essential -- arguably, the *most* essential -- part of your new resume. You should include:

* Turing projects
* Side projects
* Open Source projects
* Etc.

You should include links to your repos and deployed apps. Note: for group projects that exist on your partner's GitHub, make sure you fork your own version and include that link instead.

Your descriptions for your projects should tell a reader what the project is and what is does in as few words as possible. The rest of the description should be about accomplishments from that project and value added. What was your role in the project? What specific goals did you meet?

#### Customizing Your Resume is About Telling Your Story
Reminder that you should **always** customize your resume to the position for which you're applying. To make sure your resume is customized, pay attention to 3 things:

1. Telling your story through a summary statement
2. Showcasing specific projects
3. Highlight transferable skills

We recommend using a summary statement on your new resume so that you can:

1. Describe why you've made a career change
2. Make a connection between the company you're applying to and the work you do/want to do

Again, your projects can be used to your advantage to tell a specific story to this company as well. Showcase the projects that use the same tech stack, relate to a similar product, demonstrate your interest in their work, or showcase teamwork that is similar to the company you're applying to. A great idea is to build a project using a company's tech stack -- you'll discuss this more in-depth with Ian in his workshop.

And lastly, highlight your most relevant transferable skills -- both technical and professional -- that relate to this particular company.

#### Other Important Reminders
When building your resume, make sure to keep this checklist handy as well:

* Double check your spelling, grammar, and readability. How? Read it out loud to yourself to hear how it sounds AND ask a peer or mentor to read it also. As with coding, it never hurts to get a second set of eyes on something.
* Do not lie. This is important. Expect to be asked about **anything** that is listed on your resume. If your resume does not accurately represent you, you will not get this job, and it will hurt your chances at that company in the future.
* List work and education in chronological order. If you're concerned about gaps in your employment, list the length of time at a position rather than the dates.
* Include your contact information. Email is absolutely needed, but you can also include your LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. There are differing opinions on phone numbers, but you can decide at your own discretion.
* Don't include a headshot -- it will take up valuable space and it's not a norm in this industry.
* Your resume should only be 1 page. Employers will not read past that 1 page.
* There are a lot of templates you can use, but be conservative with colors. Consider readability and printability.
* Using a [template like those listed here](/resources/resume_resources) will ensure your resume passes an ATS system (applicant tracking system)
* Don't list your special interests or hobbies. They don't belong on a technical resume. Instead, you can put them on your LinkedIn profile.

### What to Do
This week is focused on building your working resume. These [steps are outlined in your second and third prompts in this week's career journal](/module_three/mod3_career_journal_prompts#week-1):

* Build your resume using [these templates and checklist](/resources/resume_resources)
* Upload it to CV Compiler, which is an ATS system we partner with that will provide you with feedback on your resume (instructions in the career journal).
* Update your resume using that feedback

#### Group Activity
During the session, you'll get to participate in this group activity in which you'll act as a hiring committee for a junior engineering position at your company. You need to select 1 out of the 4 following resumes to decide who to move on to an interview. For the sake of this activity, the position is language agnostic. All of these are the first technical resumes of Turing alumni.

Review these alumni resumes:

* [Erin Pintozzi](https://alumni.turing.io/sites/default/files/resumes/Erin%27s%20Resume%20020917.pdf)
* [Torie Joy-Warren](https://alumni.turing.io/sites/default/files/resumes/torie_joy_warren.pdf)
* [Andrew James](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Andrew%20James%20Resume.pdf)
* [Alex Tideman](https://alumni.turing.io/sites/default/files/resumes/alex_tideman.pdf)

Consider:

* What is your first impression of this candidate?
* What do you know about this candidate's technical abilities?
* What questions do you have about this candidate?
* Would you choose to interview this person based on their resume? Why or why not?
* If you decide to interview them, what follow-up questions would you ask?

### Turing Alumni Portfolios
Turing provides you with a space to build a portfolio on our website at [alumni.turing.io](https://alumni.turing.io/). These portfolios are how we showcase our job seeking graduates and soon-to-be graduates! We share these directly with employers, but employers also regularly come to our site to look for candidates.

#### Set Up
You'll receive an email invitation for your initial log in, but after that, log in at: [alumni.turing.io/user](https://alumni.turing.io/user). After initial set up, your username is your email without the email extension (i.e., if your email is jsmith@gmail.com, your username is jsmith)

Start your working draft following these directions:

* Professional photo (Just you! Sorry, but no kids or animals)
* Description (where you tell your professional story)
* Polished draft of resume
* At least 2 projects highlighted
  * Show variety: paired, team, individual
  * Next mod: you’ll need to have 3 projects
* Select “published” for both your profile and projects when you save them in order to display them on the site
* Check out [examples](https://alumni.turing.io/)

#### Troubleshooting
Unfortunately, this site was built by a different company and contains a lot of bugs. In order to successfully create your portfolio, you'll need to follow these directions:

* Use Safari
* Double check all fields when trying to save
* Select any cohort (cohort does not matter)
* Do not copy and paste information
  * It will not paste in correctly
* GitHub ID doesn't matter; leave it blank
