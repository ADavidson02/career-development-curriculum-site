# Career Development Curriculum

Turing’s **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. 

Turing’s career development curriculum is created directly out of this mission with a focus on **unlocking students’ potential** in modules one and two through cultivating self-awareness and empathy. In modules three and four, curriculum focuses on providing strategies to empower students to **succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers** by creating connections within the technology industry, building competencies for industry leadership, and securing a fulfilling career -- and not just another job.

* **Engagement:** Active participation in community
* **Grit:** A combination of perseverance and passion
* **Growth:** A belief that your abilities can be developed through dedication, hard work, and resiliency

### Structure of Career Development
To provide you with support in each of these areas, every week you’ll have a workshop on a specific professional development topic 

We’ll discuss this topic and give you strategies for implementing it

Throughout the rest of the week, you’ll work on it with your career journal

Where will you record this work? In your career journal! 

This journal will be something that the Career Dev team will review at the end of each mod to see your progress, and we will use this to provide even more tailored support where needed. 

Provides you with a road map for your career
